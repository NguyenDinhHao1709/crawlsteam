Inject new Legendary Lords, Heroes, and Units into your games to vastly expand your methods of play on the campaign map and within battles. The Changeling, Yuan Bo, and Mother Ostankya each bring their own unique campaign mechanics to their faction, with goals separate from the Realm of Chaos campaign, and new units to help them pursue victory on their terms. 3 new Legendary Lords emerge from the shadows. Perform dastardly schemes and trickery with the Changeling of Tzeentch. Establish and execute grand stratagems on a global scale as Yuan Bo of Grand Cathay. Conjure powerful hexes and incantations whilst engaging in witchcraft, flipping campaigns on their head as Mother Ostankya of Kislev. Embrace change with 3 new Legendary Heroes. Scatter magical spells at random with the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch, field Tzarina’s boldest champion with the Golden Knight of Kislev, Naryska Leysa, and strike from afar with the Sentinel of the Heavens, Saytang the Watcher, for Grand Cathay. Enact unsettling rituals with the Lore of the Hag; a new spell lore for Mother Ostankya and Kislev. Expand your rosters with 16 additional units, enhance your troops with 9 Regiments of Renown, and bolster your leadership with a new Lord and Hero for all 3 races. I make my home in the darkest pits of your soul. In the shadows, I bide my time. As a mighty Horror of Tzeentch, the Changeling embodies the Changer of Ways’ most deceiving and manipulative tendencies. Able to morph into any legendary character from the noble to the fearsome, the Changeling’s true form has been lost to time. His trickery may even deceive the Dark Gods themselves, able to mirror foes, create false allies, and disrupt empires from within, with only one truth becoming clear long after he’s enacted his handiwork. The deceiving prankster of the known world, the Changeling of Tzeentch, was here. As a spellcasting shapeshifter bolstering the Lore of Tzeentch, the Changeling can adopt the form of any lord he faces, making his battle efficiency grow stronger as your enemy tries to do the same. When not fighting directly, he lingers in the shadows, stalking his prey, and waiting for the optimal time to strike. Trust no one. The Changeling’s inscrutable and random nature is the perfect recipe for schemes and trickery. For the Changeling, the world is divided into Theatres; segmented regions that contain Schemes, both minor and pivotal. Fuelled by an unending legion of tricksy cultists, to achieve his goals he must first break a Theatre down through smaller, cheekier Schemes by constructing buildings, stealing identities, and instigating tensions amongst otherwise civilized populations, culminating in a Grand Scheme and an epic battle for supremacy, rife with bountiful rewards along the way. Gold, Grimoires, and Rifts aplenty. With enough Grand Schemes carried out, the Changeling’s final purpose is within reach: conducting the Ultimate Scheme for campaign victory. This troublesome Legendary Hero, the Blue Scribes, ride atop their Disc of Tzeentch, scribbling on parchment as they go, and are capable of spewing all manner of spells across the battlefield by verbalising their scrolls. If only they knew what those words meant... Those in other nations may deny it, but all mortals desire control. To be controlled, that is. Ruling over Central Cathay, Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon leads the Court of Celestial Sorcerers. A bureaucrat of the highest order on the surface, yes, but a talented spymaster at heart, the Jade Dragon runs the city of Wei-jin and, by extension, is an administrator for the Cathay empire. Liked by all, the good of Grand Cathay is in capable hands. Serving two roles between his human and dragon forms, the Jade Dragon can be a devastating single target destroyer, and a potent spellcaster with the Light, Yin, and Heaven lores of magic. Soar above the battlefield as a dragon, burning down even the strongest of enemy units, or take the fight on the ground with game-changing spells at your side. Cathay stands, all the same. Engage in a chess match unlike any other with the Matters of State. As a master statesman, a right hand to the emperor and a spymaster, Yuan Bo’s influence over the kingdom runs deep. With this power, enact overt and covert policies across settlements, armies and even characters to best suit your empire’s needs. Crack down on settlement corruption, rush construction for your entire empire in a single move, create diplomatic deadlocks to move freely through unfriendly territories, and much, much more. Go beyond mere balance and embrace disharmony, leveraging it as an excuse to serve more severe and extreme actions to fit your agenda, and plan chains of actions to ensure the balance of harmony is pulled back in your favour when all is said and done. Yuan Bo doesn’t follow the rules. He writes them. With a plan centuries in the making under the request of Yuan Bo’s father, the Jade Dragon is tasked with travelling to critical locations and constructing relays to empower the Jade Compass, before defending them from the Lizardmen incursions trying to dismantle Cathay. Destroy them, and plot a course to victory. For years we thought she was a child's tale to frighten us into behaving. Then one day, in my twentieth winter, I got too close to the woods. And when I was told Mother Ostankya would get you... I knew if I took one step closer to the trees it would be true. Tales of monsters and bogeymen have haunted many lands for centuries, but the tale hanging above the Kislevite children, a reminder of the consequences for displaying disobedience, was not just a tale. Mother Ostankya is real. A guardian, faithful to the land, holding anyone who seeks to harm it accountable, she draws her power from the very woods, fens and oblasts that she protects. When war comes knocking, she’ll be on the front lines, protecting the warriors of Kislev, and inflicting her terror upon any who oppose them. And if you cross her path, make no mistake. Mother Ostankya will punish you. As a powerful sorceress with a bespoke melee component, Mother Ostankya utilises her cauldron on and off the battlefield, able to rain spirits down upon her foes from afar or sprout the legs of a spider in melee combat as an artillery-chariot hybrid. The Daughters of the Forest must infuse Mother Ostankya’s Witchcraft at the Witch’s Hut. With a new rare resource, Spirit Essence, you can take advantage of ingredients gathered during your playthrough to create potent Incantations and utilise Hexes to vastly change the course of your entire campaign. Force enemy armies from your lands in an instant, purge entire provinces of corruption in a single move, buff your units far beyond their given capability, and unleash the full might of the witch as you search for the Malediction of Ruin; Mother Ostankya’s final Hex to secure the sanctity of Kislevite land. Welcome a world of change with new additional units for Tzeentch, Grand Cathay, and Kislev. Field an abomination with the Mutalith Vortex Beast for Tzeentch, a horrific fusion of monster and magic, created by the powers of Chaos beyond any justifiable reason. It brings raw, magical destruction to the table with violent spectacle. It won’t take a compass to find the new additions to the Cathayan roster. Crafted by the wizards of the Celestial Court, Guardian Lions are living statues made from Jet or Jade. For those seeking a magical touch, the Jade Lion is a sorcerer's conduit, able to use spells bound to its body and launch flaming attacks. The Jet Lion, however, is the opposite, countering magical spells to diminish any sorcery that may harm themselves or those nearby. Plus, new Kislevite units lurk in these woods. A terrible and frightening creature, known to many as The Thing in the Woods, brings its enormous size and infantry sundering capability to the frontlines of Kislev. Left unchecked, this beast will tear through enemy troops like paper, before rushing into the woods for cover and emerging to do it all over again. And, of course, further horrors await within the Shadows of Change.", "review_summary": "Mostly Negative", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 6 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 120 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " 3.4GHz Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD Ryzen CPU equivalent"},

Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.

Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically. Dungeon Maker In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the campaign is over. Unleash your creativity and craft your own dungeons to play and share with friends with the snap of a finger using the in-game Dungeon Maker!

DESTROY THEIRS. Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh… Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 5 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 60 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " 3.4GHz Intel Core i3-4130"},

As both emperor and battle commander you must lead one of six playable factions to victory against the threat of extinction! Real-time Tactics meets 4X Depth There are no turns. There is no battle mode. There is no strategic mode. It's all one mode and it's all in real-time. Instantly zoom in to control tactical engagements where every missile, turret, and ship is fully simulated and an important part of the battle. Instantly zoom back out to manage your empire where every asteroid, moon, and planet orbits its parent in a slowly evolving strategic landscape. Unparalleled Gameplay Experiences Sins of a Solar Empire II delivers sprawling empires, huge fleets, and completely new and exciting gameplay moments that can only be found in Sins II. The Surprise: Build a secondary fleet on a rogue asteroid and launch a devastating surprise attack when its orbit brings it behind the enemy's back line. The Body Block: Stall an enemy's home planet bombardment by using your massive titan to body block swarms of missiles attempting to knock out your starbase and its critical planetary shield. The Screen: Advance a screen of point defense flak frigates to protect your fragile long-range cruisers by intercepting incoming bombers and missiles. The Swarm: Maneuver your faster moving ships to pick apart unescorted larger ships. Their powerful but slow-moving turrets simply can't track your agile strike force. The Influencer: Influence a hostile expansionist Minor Faction to secure your border while reserving enough Influence to win an auction for a powerful item to install on your best capital ship. The Backstab: Protect yourself from a backstab by establishing a time locked alliance. But pay attention to the time - your “ally” may move his fleet to your doorstep just as the lock expires! Features A Dynamic Galaxy: Planets orbit their stars in real-time causing the galaxy's structure to slowly change, creating new battle fronts and new opportunities. Players can view the state of the galaxy up to an hour in the future to prepare their strategies. 3 Unique Races: It's War Year 35 and the emergent TEC, alien Vasari, and deviant Advent have been forced to adapt and evolve to survive. TEC: The inhabitants of this region of the galaxy, the TEC are humans who have joined together as the Trader Emergency Coalition to combat the alien Vasari empire. They rely heavily on trade to support their industrial base and augment resource income. Vasari: Ten thousand years ago, the Vasari Empire once ruled over hundreds of planets and dozens of sentient species. Now on the run from an unknown enemy they use their mastery of phase space to conquer and acquire resources to continue their exodus. Advent: A civilization of humans who were forcibly outcast by the Traders over a thousand years ago, the deviant Advent have returned with technologically amplified psionics and the power of the Unity - a devastating expression of their collective will. Each race features unique starting conditions, gameplay mechanics, units, abilities, items, and technologies. Their game changing new Empire Systems add a whole new level of strategic capabilities: TEC Trade: The new TEC trade system enables them to dynamically adapt their economy by adjusting the allocation of traded resources on demand. Vasari Phase Resonance: Strategically placed structures collect Phase Resonance allowing the Vasari to customize their global phase mastery effects. Advent Unity: Enables the Advent to harness the collective will of their population, unlocking the full potential of the Unity's global abilities. 6 Playable Factions: The parent races are further differentiated by unique sub-factions each with their own unique features and play styles that reflect their motivations and goals. For example, the TEC: Primacy is a xenophobic 'human first' empire focused on aggression and the Vasari: Exodus is willing to destroy planets to fuel their mobile empire. Combat Simulation: A detailed combat simulation adds incredible depth to tactical gameplay. Turrets with their own pitch and tracking speeds make firing solutions important in battles. Fully simulated missiles can be blocked by ships or destroyed by point defense. New mechanics around shields, armor and hull points give greater depth to units and tactical decisions. Empire Management: All planets and ships can now be easily analyzed, customized, and upgraded in one place without the tedium of finding and clicking through all units in your empire. The Intelligent Construction system will queue up the entire chain of prerequisites to fulfill any item, research, or unit build request. Fleet Management: The new fleet system includes the ability to request specific reinforcements on the fly. Requested units are automatically queued from the optimal factory and rallied to the fleet. Combined with Intelligent Construction this allows you to focus on the important tactical decisions and big picture strategy. Unit Customization: Planet surfaces can now be customized with special items that vary by race and planet type. Capital ships, titans and starbases can also be customized with race specific items to fill gaps in the fleet's composition or target specific strategies. Minor Factions: Numerous minor factions now inhabit the galaxy offering trade, auctions for rare items, and with enough influence, access to their most powerful abilities. Will you befriend them or annihilate them to keep your enemies from turning them against you? Diplomacy: New features include a new offer / counteroffer system, the ability to give or demand planets, and the game changing time locked cease-fires that prevent your 'ally' from backstabbing you until it expires - but keep on eye on the time! Multicore 64-bit Engine: The Sins II engine can utilize all available cores and RAM to maximize performance, now and into the future. Dynamic lighting, physically based rendering, higher resolution textures and more create a beautiful tapestry. 10-Player Multiplayer Support: A cloud based online system supports both 'join codes' and lobbies to make it easier than ever to play with others. Games can now be rejoined in progress if a player drops or has to leave; humans can even take over for AI players if a friend joins late. In-game Mod Support: Mod support has been integrated into the game, making it easy to discover, install, and share mods. Custom maps are automatically shared for multiplayer games, preventing the hassle of everyone downloading ahead of time. Easy to Learn; Hard to Master: With an elegant and intuitive user interface Sins II is easy to pick up and play.

{"name": "The Outlast Trials", "release_date": "5 Mar, 2024", "final_price_number_original": 470000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 470000.0, "description": "About This Game Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same? SYNOPSIS Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit. SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players. Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial. Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out. Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges. Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map. HIDE OR FLIGHT In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them. The tools will allow you to Stun enemies Blind them See through walls Heal yourself and people around you. Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize and create your own trial patient. Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish. Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it? INVESTIGATE You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients. The Process: Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down. Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity. Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground. Content and Photosensitivity Warning: The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.

SCUM is a truly immersive and hyper realistic survival experience where you have total control of your progression. You start as a prisoner on the super-max SCUM island under the watchful eye of the sinister TEC1 corporation. Roam the rolling fields, lush forests and other rugged terrains of the island, using skills, guts and cunning to survive. Incredibly complex simulation makes every detail matter. Eat the right diet, keep your wounds free of infection or it won’t just be the physical threats that take your life. Seek to take out other players or join forces while you loot and craft your way to better gear and weaponry. Flex your creative muscles with extensive base building options and reinforcements that will make your fortress impenetrable. The island is vast and full of ways to die, from fellow prisoners to killer mechs and sinister ‘puppets’ suspended between life and death. All you have is what you’re carrying – everything else is up to you. Inventory space is minimal. Progression will be tough. Noobs will die. Oh, and one more thing… you’re not just a prisoner. TEC1 is also an entertainment company, and they’re broadcasting every triumph and failure on SCUM island to a bloodthirsty audience of millions.  So smile...you’re on TV. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev updates on the SCUM website and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems, allowing you to go as deep as you choose into character creation and management. Immerse yourself in the survival experience through systems that control your character’s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Explore 225 square kilometres of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns and rundown airfields. This enormous terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft. Each location tells its own story, presenting new dangers…and opportunities, too. Tough progression: loot what you can and craft with raw materials. Improvise, adapt and upgrade. Think smart, take risks and carry what you need. Build and protect your base with a wide range of customization options. Grow your character and become the terror of the whole island. Omnipresent threat: Discover new ways to die in a punishing world without a moral code. Face your fellow prisoners, armed mechs, undead puppets and your own metabolic system – if your rivals don’t get you, maybe dehydration will. Online Multiplayer: You can go solo or squad up. Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server. EARLY ACCESS ROADMAP FEATURES PLANNED FOR VERSION 1.0 The following features are not yet in SCUM and are planned as a part of the Early Access period.

Achieve your dreams in life by ticking items off your Bucket List or pursue them as a Ghost with Unfinished Business. There is a ghastly new world to haunt, a career that’ll bring you closer to Grim, Wills to write, Crypts to explore, and even ghostly skills to master. There are no real endings — only transitions — as you move between life, afterlife, and even rebirth. Purchase now to get the Macabre Mementos Digital Content. Wonder at treasures that have endured time’s passing, witnessing the come-and-go of generations with ghastly grace. Look upon those who came before in the Lasting Legacy Family Portrait, listen to the haunting lullaby of the Mournful Melodies Music Box, and masquerade in fowl finery with the Plumed Elegance Mask, available when you order through December 12**. KEY FEATURES: An Endless Journey — Build your Bucket List by collecting goals throughout your Sim’s life, starting as a Young Adult. Items will appear on your list based on your Sim’s traits and family relations, and you can also choose your own. Removing items is possible, but completing them yields powerful rewards. If a Sim’s life ends with items still on their list, they can devote their afterlife to completing their Unfinished Business. The ultimate reward for experiencing everything on their list is the option to be Reborn, though you can still choose to Move On or remain on this plane as a Ghost. A Ghastly, Gorgeous Life — Make death your life’s work with a career of reaping souls, helping Ghosts, dispersing hauntings, and more as a member of Grim’s team. Or, you could become a Mortician and deal with death more from the perspective of the living. Outside of work, you might spend your days exploring Crypts and building your Thanatology skill for the new Ghost Historian Aspiration. These things — among other dark diversions like bonding with your Pet Crow (careful, provoking it could be deadly) or collecting and reading the lost Tarot Cards of Lady Ravendancer Goth — will have a special appeal to Sims who are Macabre, one of 3 new traits. Goodbye (For Now) — Different Sims will grieve in different ways. There are 4 types that will tie in with both Sims’ personalities and their relationships with the deceased. Grieving Rituals are customizable and unscripted, allowing you to hold whatever type of event (or events) fits your story. In life, Sims can create Wills which can be used to pass down Heirlooms, assign guardians for surviving dependents, distribute their Simoleons, and more. Sims can honor the departed with a memorial display featuring their portrait and by interring their urns in Crypts or with Custom Caskets and Gravesites. Friendly or Fiendish? — Linger on as a Ghost, and spend your afterlife helping or terrorizing the living. Ghosts will grow in their abilities as they do everything from assisting with household chores to levitating living Sims and hanging them upside down (fun AND profitable — they may drop Simoleons!). Their interactions with the living can earn them Fear or Goodwill essences, which can both be sold for Simoleons. There’s a lot to do after death; Ghosts can even pair up for a special, spectral Woohoo. A Town Worth Haunting — The veil between life and death is thin in Ravenwood, a 3-neighborhood town. Visit the countryside and perhaps take a swim by the mysterious face in the cliffs. Or, head into the village where you’ll find some odd goods for purchase near the old Specter cemetery, a haunted house to brave, or a festival to attend. The residents of these first 2 neighborhoods are (mostly) alive, but it’s Ghosts who will feel most at home in the third, where you’ll find 2 more festivals and a spectral support group. Living Sims can use its Baleful Bog to have an out-of-body experience and try their hands at being temporary Ghosts. Well, it’s usually temporary.

{"name": "Diplomacy is Not an Option", "release_date": "4 Oct, 2024", "final_price_number_original": 385000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 250000.0, "description": "About This Game Diplomacy is Not an Option is a base-building survival RTS with an active pause, taking place in a medieval fantasy setting, where your choices can decide the destiny of the world. You step into the well-worn shoes of the minor Lord. Circumstances force you to fight. Like all the time. Always outnumbered. Build your walls, raise your armies, and experience warfare on an entirely new scale. Over 25 THOUSAND enemies assault your castle walls. You're going to master engineering, economy and even magic If you hope to survive. Your King is a mighty and powerful leader. Also, he is an egocentric pig. Adores to drink and in general he's enjoying his life. But after the treasury had emptied and even raising taxes had not helped, it became clear that he could not continue his leisurely lifestyle. Which is a problem. Mostly yours. Because peasants, who are not fond of raised taxes and hunger, are rioting in your feud. King demands you put down the rebellion and go to the distant land to get some gold. (Rumors are there is one where there are tons of it) Will you do as your sovereign bids and set sail to replenish the palace coffers? Will you join the violent leader of rebels to bring the tyrant to justice? Will you help poor natives of Uncharted Continent? Or will you cast aside human nature and ambition and lead armies of Undead? Questions, questions, questions. The one thing you can be sure of is that no matter what faction you support there will be blood anyway. And legions of archers, swordsmen, siege weapons, knights, and more will be staying by your side for you to achieve your goal. While admittedly tongue-in-cheek, the laws of physics are still deadly serious in Diplomacy Is Not An Option. Every arrow, catapult stone and enemy launched skywards is physically modeled, making for a tactile and coherent battlefield. Just make sure your troops have towers to shoot from and clear lines of sight, or you might find your best-laid plans embarrassingly blunted by your own fortifications. Consider your gates, your lines of advancement and retreat. Create kill-zones and fall-back positions. You will need to take an active role in combat to get the best from your men. Even under siege, never forget your castle was built on the backs of the peasantry. Defend your people, and they’ll serve you well. Engage in agriculture and farming, or food can become scarce, and your soldiers can starve on the battlefield. Build houses, bury fallen soldiers and peasants to prevent plague, and treat the infected when death comes knocking. If you do not care for your people you may soon find yourself overrun with the most unpleasant troubles. Like empty stockpiles, unrepaired walls and running dry barracks… or be overrun literally with swarms of zombies. And no lord wishes to see zombie apocalypse in the backyard of his castle, right? A functional army requires a functional economy to support and feed it. Food, Wood, Stone, Iron, and Gold are the foundations of your city’s economy, and you will need to watch your supplies carefully if you are to meet the advancing foe in a timely manner. Gather resources, choose your storage locations, plan your expansions and upgrades with care. The enemy will not cede their lands willingly, and unprotected civilian expansions will have consequences of falling prey to the hostile incursion. Trade, via the impressive merchant dirigible, bringing emergency supplies of food to feed the men, or stone to rebuild the walls. Can you strike the balance between greedy expansion and security? If life gives you lemons, make lemonade. If you’ve inherited a cursed kingdom, why not master the dark arts? Sturdy castle walls will protect you from most ordinary threats, but in Diplomacy Is Not An Option you're also be battling undeads. So why give them a monopoly on magic? There is a dark history of tainted power that stirs zombies and traps wayward souls. On the lighter side: it can also be used to call down really very big fireballs onto your enemies. So enjoy that too. Build magical monuments, harvest soul crystals and give a try to a maniacal laugh as searing magical beams tear through your foes and summoned ghosts to chase down the stragglers. The game has been designed with freedom as a core concept. Go beyond the campaign and crush your foes as you see fit in Endless Mode, Sandbox Mode or Challenge Mode. Develop your own personal strategies on procedurally generated maps. Go heavy on walls early, build large armies of cannon-fodder, or pursue the macro game of greedy growth and costly investments. Play battles in real-time or use pause constantly to keep everything in your hands. Will you be able to stand on a par with the most acclaimed generals in the world, like Joan of Arc and Genghis Khan? Finding which style grants you the most success is up to you. As in real life, stupidity and greed lie behind most problems, but here it is far too late to talk it through. You have no recourse to resolve this peacefully.

{"name": "UFO 50", "release_date": "18 Sep, 2024", "final_price_number_original": 321000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 321000.0, "description": "About This Game UFO 50 is a collection of 50 single and multiplayer games from the creators of Spelunky, Downwell, and Catacomb Kids. Explore a variety of genres, from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design. 50 BRAND NEW GAMES - These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world adventures and a JRPG that could take many hours to beat. AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE - According to the story of UFO 50, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. Some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity. AN INSTANT LIBRARY - All 50 games are available to play at the start! The concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend's house and perusing their game library. Jump in and out of games at a whim - exploring the collection is part of the fun! AUTHENTIC BUT ALSO MODERN - We carefully chose what elements to modernize. Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that UFO 50 was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past. VERSUS AND CO-OP PLAY - Half of the collection features local multiplayer, including co-op and versus. You can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or strategy game... or team up to beat a classic arcade game from an alternate timeline. It's great for groups! Here are some of games you'll get to play in UFO 50: CAMPANELLA 2 - The sequel to Campanella (another game in UFO 50), Campanella 2 features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your UFO but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. You play as the intrepid treasure-hunter Isabell, but she hasn't always been a hero - by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past. QUIBBLE RACE - In this unique sci-fi \"horse-racing\" game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? Thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. But your opponents can do the same, so the question is... how well can you anticipate their actions? Up to 3 players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing. PINGOLF - A fan favorite at gaming get-togethers like PAX, Pingolf is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. As you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on! SEASIDE DRIVE - Sometimes you'll want a break from long, open-world games and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style action game like Seaside Drive? But even in a popular genre, UFO 50 brings something new to the table - in this case, Ojiro Fumoto (the creator of Downwell) designed a stylish car-based shoot 'em up where \"drifting\" across the screen is how you power-up your gun. GRIMSTONE - Yes, there is a full blown JRPG in the collection! Grimstone follows many conventions from 8-bit console RPGs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. Also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. The story takes place in the American Wild West, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by Hell! Creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you'll be looking for answers as to why it happened. And that's just five games! Out of 50! So come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension!

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. “This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "VOID Interactive", "publisher": "VOID Interactive", "game_tag": "Tactical", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 60 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5-4430 / AMD FX-6300"},

Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or co-op online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. KEY GAME FEATURES • Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. • Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria.

Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. • Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. • Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. • Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. • Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. • Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator.

You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future. Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court. Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor—and to test your strength. Explore - Conquer - Rule! The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you. Whether you’re new to the Pathfinder® universe or you’re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the CRPG you’ve been waiting for.", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "Owlcat Games", "publisher": "Owlcat Games", "game_tag": "RPG", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 30 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i7-3610QE @ 2.30GHz"},

Your librarians will fight for the Library. Combat between the guests and the librarians breaks out as if it were on a stage. Defeated guests turn into books, and the Library grows onward. A good book will allow you to invite new guests with greater secrets. Amass a collection of books and explore the secrets of the City. And eventually, get your hands on… The one singular, perfect book. [A Library Battle Simulation] Library of Ruina is a game that uses the concept of a “Library Battle Simulation”. You will invite guests to the Library and engage in combat with them to gain 'Books' with their stories. Battles are played with the 'Librarians' and the 'Guests' using cards and dice. You can plan against the guests’ moves by looking at the cards they will use and select the most optimal card to oppose them. When combat begins, how the dice from your chosen card fall will determine victory or defeat in the struggle. However, the outcome of the dice is not simply determined by pure luck. Certain effects and variables will shift the outcome of the dice for and against your favor. Be sure to carefully choose which cards you utilize to win the battle with your guests. Behold the outcome of your choices and how luck unfolds as your librarians and guests skirmish. You can go through an exhilarating experience, putting it all on the line with thrills just like betting. [Conflicts that Build Emotion] Confrontation in the Library is not just about killing your enemies, it is about heightening emotions. The emotions of the librarians and guests rise as the battle progresses, and as it grows fiercer and comes to a head, they will surge. Depending on your librarian's feelings, positive outcomes or powerful effects with penalties can occur. In addition, as the emotional tension of the guests grows, the difficulty of combat increases, yet at the same time, rarer books can be acquired. Furthermore, dialogue can appear depending on the situation of the battle and will make one’s viewing experience of the match unfolding even more enjoyable. [Books Can Be Anything] A guest who dies in the Library will turn into a book. These books can be a librarian's body, materials to grow the Library, or new cards for battle. You can also use books as the parts of an invitation to bring forth another guest. Invite different guests to acquire various books, then utilize them accordingly. How you make use of your collection to grow the Library is up to you. [The Story of the City and the Library] In Library of Ruina, you will be witness to the stories of Angela, the Sephirot, and Roland following the ending of Lobotomy Corporation. You will also watch various events occurring around the huge city in which the Library is located.

Conquer territories and fly your colors! A struggle for land where new strategies are born: from points to planes! The vast land of China is represented a single realistic map, with the characteristics of the land replicated beautifully in CG. The vast map is comprised of 46 cities and approximately 340 regions. The regions are collections of detailed territories, and the struggle for land is intuitively expressed through a color scheme. Players can conquer territories to unite the land and fly their colors more elaborately and more freely. New strategies created by supply lines and maintaining the front line When troops are on the march, and the march origin city is connected to land controlled by the players’ forces, the supply lines will be maintained and troops can battle with ample supplies provided to them. However, if the connection with the march origin city is cut, the troops will lose their supply lines and will be weakened and fall into a disorderly state. Securing the supply lines is an integral part in maintaining the battle front. Administration changes completely by doctrine and a unique policy! Players can organize the administration, the center of power, as an element that expands the player's strategy. Administration is shown in an organization chart, and as retained officers are added to the organization, various commands and effects are obtained. It is important to make administration that suits your own strategy. More than 150 “characters” and over 1,000 officers – the most in the series! More than 1,000 unique officers, which is the largest in the series, are in the game, and each officer is given a “character” (trait). There are more than 150 characters, with some being useful in battle, some in administration and so on.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun. Key Features Renovate, run and expand a gas station in the desert. Build new services like a workshop, shop, warehouse or car wash. Try to handle everything on your own or hire employees to help out. Interesting events on top of the normal gameplay.

Expand, exploit, and dominate the Warhammer world as Astragoth Ironhand, Drazhoath the Ashen, and Zhatan the Black, collectively boasting unique campaign mechanics, objectives, and units that only the evil minds of the Chaos Dwarfs could forge. With their own frightful agenda to pursue, they do not engage with the Ursun storyline in the Realm of Chaos campaign. •\tBurn it all down as 3 new Legendary Lords: Astragoth Ironhand, Drazhoath the Ashen, and Zhatan the Black. •\tRecruit Gorduz Backstabber to sneak behind your foes as the newest Legendary Hero. •\tMaster chaotic magic with the all-new Lore of Hashut. Strike foes down with Hell Hammer or set them ablaze with Burning Wrath. •\tConstruct the Great Drill of Hashut to break open Hashut’s domain and siphon his blood for cataclysmic powers. •\tCo-operate with your fellow Chaos Dwarfs to obtain District rewards in the Tower of Zharr or usurp others for their Seats in your quest for supremacy. •\tCommand a comprehensive army roster of over 26 new units, featuring the baleful Chaos Dwarf war machine trains and the new K’daai Destroyers, alongside some of the Old World’s cruellest infernal warriors. Astragoth Ironhand, High Priest of Hashut, is the oldest living Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer-Prophet. Once the most potent sorcerer to walk the Plain of Zharrduk in a thousand years, his powers have begun to wane and his body is slowly succumbing to petrification, negated only by the mechanical device that grants his body movement. As an armoured caster with a mixed spell lore, Astragoth zips around the battlefield at a respectable speed and can hold his own up close. Drazhoath the Ashen, Sorcerer Prophet of Hashut, is the Lord of the Black Fortress and commander of the fell Legion of Azgorh. Exiled to the land he now rules, Drazhoath’s mastery of magic and engineering has only grown stronger. As a mighty warrior and a powerful spellcaster, Drazhoath is a nigh unstoppable force, whether he’s splitting skulls on foot or scarring the lands mounted upon Cinderbreath – his Bale Taurus. Zhatan the Black is the Chaos Dwarf Commander of the Tower of Zharr. Serving his master Ghorth the Cruel, Zhatan provides him with plentiful Labour and resources to fuel their growing empire whilst meeting his insatiable thirst for sacrifices. Known for his high demand for weaponry, boundless cruelty, and greater stature, Zhatan is a bone-crunching powerhouse. With some of the most unique units in WARHAMMER III to date, the Chaos Dwarfs utilise their engineering prowess with Earthshaker-launching Dreadquake Mortars, Volcanic Magma Cannons, and Daemonic Iron war machines to pull their trains of destruction across the battlefield. On the Daemonic side, set the lands ablaze with the monstrous K’daai Fireborn and K’daai Destroyer units; both bolted with heavy armour to contain a source of disruptive power never before seen in the Mortal World. The Chaos Dwarfs seek an unimaginable power, the Blood of Hashut, to conquer the known world. But they must first construct the Great Drill of Hashut to burrow into the domain of their mighty God, which can only be done by stealing and corrupting a number of precious Dwarfen relics. Once the Great Drill is complete, it can begin to dig to the world's core, churning through earth, rock, and the very fabric of reality itself to breach Hashut's domain. But the Dwarfs hold grudges, seeking revenge for the tainting of their ancient heirlooms, and their aim is to stop you. With a multi-layered economy centred around the gathering and management of labourers, the Chaos Dwarfs capture those that they best in combat and assign them to gruelling work in their Mining Outposts, where they harvest Raw Materials used to expand the Chaos Dwarfen empire, construct advanced buildings, and strengthen their armies. With the Hell-Forge at their disposal, the mighty Chaos Dwarf legions can grow mightier with special schematics forged in fire, and those schematics apply a set of bonuses to the allocated units so they may thrive on the battlefield. The Chaos Dwarfs vie for ownership of special Seats within this mighty Tower, granting their faction unique rewards upon success. Chaos Dwarfs can also cooperate to complete Districts, benefiting the whole culture, or battle it out for specific Seats by usurping each other’s rule. The Chaos Dwarfs are famed arms merchants, supplying the forces of Chaos with weapons, armours, and war machines. By using Convoys, you can trade your tools of war in return for a wide variety of resources.", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": "Dwarf", "minimum_ram": " 6 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 120 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " 3.4GHz Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD Ryzen CPU equivalent"},

As long as you find a way to steal them. Know that a thief’s trade is not a piece of cake. In order to get some practice, you’ll start with petty theft. This is how you’ll gain the experience required to access more and more risky – and most importantly, more profitable – jobs. Gain levels and unlock new possibilities. Get useful tools. Together with newly acquired skills, they will pave the way to expensive items, which you can then sell on the black market. The tools of your trade include a crowbar and binoculars, as well as advanced equipment that becomes available as you progress, such as a laptop for hacking through security systems. The creators of Thief Simulator 2 have prepared two unique locations with houses, banks, restaurants, and other special places that you’ll get to strip of money, valuables, and other items. But before you do, examine the surroundings: find out when the building empties out, learn the tenants’ or the employees’ schedule. Then you just need to prepare a strategy and it’s gone time. Just be quick and efficient. You don’t have much time, so you’ll need to immediately assess which item to take and which one to leave. Can you handle the pressure, or will you panic? Make sure to work on cars between robbing buildings. Start with small family sedans and make gradual steps towards mastery, which will allow you to steal the coolest sports cars. Remember to keep your eyes around your head. Even the best plan can fall apart, and the local police are just waiting for a chance to put you in handcuffs. Don’t get caught. Always be one step ahead of law enforcement. Feature list Two neighborhoods, with over 20 houses to break into. Learn tenant's routines, pick the right time to break in, and then rob them Three heists, each with a unique location. Make your way into a resort with 6 houses full of loot, a warehouse crawling with guards, and a central bank with gold waiting to be snatched from the vault. Get better and better tools, ranging from a crowbar or binoculars to hacking laptops, stethoscopes, etc. Make your way into houses undetected, or run in welding a baton and knock everyone out. Alternatively, put them to sleep using sleeping gas or a tranquilizer gun. The choice is up to you. Payphone missions - rob certain locations in a specified amount of time Over 15 contracts requiring you to steal unique items Level up your thief and acquire new skills, which allow a number of new possibilities. Learn special skills, and activate unique abilities. Escape the police - intense chases with police cars and helicopters. Be careful to not get shot. Upgrade your car, change its color, give it more power - or just buy a sports car and be no match for the police.

After many years of horrid disasters in succession one after another, the Ming court continued to impose inhumane policies resulting in widespread starvation and leading to the rise of multiple rebellions against the court. Liang the bandit, and his companion are commissioned for a job from an unsavory merchant and must escort four girls to a wealthy lord in the city of Luoyang. They must pass through Huazhou, Wenxiang, Shanzhou, and finally reach their destination of Luoyang. Liang initially believes that the girls he is escorting will be sold to the wealthy lord as adopted daughters to begin a new life. However, one of the four girls named “Sui” reveals the hidden secret of their journey to Luoyang. The lord is a swine demon who has practiced devouring young ladies for over a thousand years. Every year on his birthday, he dispatches human traffickers to abduct girls from Shan in celebration of his special day. Sui’s sister was among the many who have fallen victim to the demon’s appetite. Sui is hopeful that Liang will end the escort and join her in assassinating the swine demon to avenge her sister, and those who have perished in recent years. Although Liang wants to believe Sui, there are too many inconsistencies in her story. Throughout the journey, Liang will gather information, unravel the truth, and make his decisions accordingly. Play as Liang, the main character and protagonist. His family has run a successful business for years, but Liang never saw himself as his father’s successor. Instead, he would rather travel the world as a hero and visit as many new locations as possible. The day of the Great Tianqi Explosion in 1626, was the day Liang lost everything. After becoming a refugee with nothing left to his name, he turned to a life of crime. Liang became a bandit and makes a living by killing others for loot. Sui, a nine-year-old mute born in Luoyang. Her sister was killed by the swine demon that also dwells in Luoyang. To avenge her sister’s death, she intentionally let her self-become abducted to get close to the demon and assassinate him. Some, or all of the above statement is false, part of Sui’s untrustworthy nature. Liang’s partner Tongue, the silver-tongued devil who is motivated by greed. When they work jobs together, Liang executes their target's lives while Tongue works on securing loot. A girl from an authoritative family that was abducted by human traffickers. It is said to be a distant relative of governor general Yuan. One of the two sisters from Northern Shannxi who was sold by her parents in a year of turmoil. She is full of vigor and an honest person, who cares deeply about her sister. One of the two sisters from Northern Shannxi, also sold by her parents. She is charming, pure of heart, and is also very dependent on her older sister. An old friend of Liang, who owns an inn outside of Haizhou city. In the fifth year of Chongzhen (1633), a rebel leader came to Jin from Shan and called himself the \"Dashing King\". The swine demon disguised as a wealthy lord that devours young girls on his birthday for thousands of years, according to Sui. He is also the one who has commissioned Liang to escort the four girls to the city of Luoyang. There are a variety of different endings and branch options, but good deeds cannot be rewarded during times of war. Pay for the crimes Liang has committed and suffer the consequences.

{"name": "Banquet for Fools", "release_date": "30 Sep, 2024", "final_price_number_original": 260000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 221000.0, "description": "About This Game Story The deities have shunned the Vollings, and they have turned to paganism to survive. But Vollings are resilient and ever industrious. One lord has embarked on an enterprise to settle an island long abandoned by its dead civilization, braving a cursed land in hopes of farming a lucrative spice grown only on its hillsides. His venture is a success, but trouble quickly presses fast upon him from many sides. As he is leaving to sail out to defend his fields from a jealous neighbor, he has received word that every inhabitant of one of his farm holds has vanished without a trace. With few options at hand, he calls on his guards for four volunteers to venture across the island to investigate this mystery. Party-based adventure Explore the island of Invimona in this open-world adventure with four generated companions. Depending on the stats given to them they'll each have unique choices in dialogue with NPCs and amongst each other as they bond over the course of the journey. You're assigned a pack-boro for your mission, who can carry a boat as well as extra items you pick up along the way, and together you all can hike and portage around the Invimona rivers and sea. Visit towns for clues and to stock your party with unique items. As a guard you will be asked for assistance as you meet various farmers, scribes, artisans and even Gadaars among the holds. In the five years since the island was settled, grave robbers have flocked to Invimona like vultures, and ensuring they find their way to Exile Island is a constant battle. There is no auto-compass or quest logs for you in Banquet for Fools, though many quests and requests are given to you in scrolls. Navigating the island effectively is a part of the challenge of quests. Skills Equip your four companions you've created with a variety of skills to overcome the challenges your adventure will take you through. Choose favored weapons, armor, pagan spells, animal binding, music and rogue abilities and level them up with experience or with buying training from individuals you meet around the island. Skills used most are granted bonuses to get more powerful with level ups. Character Advancement how you want When a character accrues enough XP they can choose to level up their skills and a stat point. You have 3 points to distribute into any of the skills you wish to pursue, and skills you’ve used frequently during the interim of the last level up are granted bonus points if you advance them. Intercessions Though the Volling have entered a pagan age, their ancient deities still listen through their likeness in stone, and perhaps if they find the speakers worthy, speak back... Asking for intercessions from these beings grants Vollings the ability to make custom holy items uniquely tailored to those favored, but these boons come with a required donation and completion of a quest to deem yourself worthy. These beings are petty gods, and competitive, so choose your statues wisely. Find ancient and newly erected statues around the island with various powers to bestow, and bless new intercessions with even more powerful versions as you advance. Songs Configure your musical setlist during combat by buying songs with situational auto-procing and potency levels. Songs can proc at the start of a battle, after an enemy is fallen, when companions are low on health, and a myriad of options between! You can memorize a limited amount of songs at once with different power levels, so choose which songs are heaviest and when they’ll occur to compliment your playstyle and party composition. Pagan Spells Learn unique spell effects from different Vol trees, then make a custom spell of your choosing by taking its birch and etch your rune in blood to communicate this tether with the world. Create more powerful variants as you grow in power during the course of your travels. There are three Pagan skills: Fauna, Vines, and Spores, each with different specialties and application to the world. Rogue A wily party knows when to keep the law they're employed to uphold, when to bend it, and when breaking it is the best course of action. Items can be stolen from shops, but at the cost of not being able to be purchased again, and getting caught is always a risk. Guards and merchants follow patrols and sleep schedules, so keeping tabs on your surroundings and waiting for the changing of the guard is a ripe opportunity. Committing crimes will accrue a price on your head, and the Vollings of the villages will treat you accordingly. You can always pay off a local bounty by yelling bribe. Field Kit Running out of arrows mid-dungeon? Stuck on an island with Padurii children hiding in every tree and low on explosive elyxirs? Having a field kit in your inventory allows a party to re-supply while away from shops during hikes across the island. The field kit allows you to assemble ammunition for three types of categories: arrows, darts, and elyxirs. Arrows come from finding wood pieces and various types of arrow heads from wildlife, poisonous darts are crafted from noxious and volatile foliage in crevices, and you can convert amphoras of alcohol from healing items into explosive elyxirs with various added effects. Guard Duties The Pavura requests that instead of being executed, criminals be shipped off to a husk of a rock just north of his garrison which the locals call Exile Island. The local ghost population is haunting enough, and the ethereal grave keepers of the Carrion god would want nothing more than to add to this assembly. You can choose on the fly if your party is attacking to kill or stun, the consequence of which is yours to decide. Killing hostile combatants is less risky, but they could be resurrected into ghosts if a keeper is near. Stunning will knock out your enemy for 24 hours, and if that enemy is a bandit or grave robber, you can report them for coins in your purse, though Exile Island will get more populated with each turn-in. Stunned criminals will only stay stunned for so long, and you’ll need to reach a local fort or village to tell another guard to send a wagon and pick up your purse. The list of criminal acts is something worth keeping in mind before exacting justice, and your characters need to bear witness, otherwise unless your characters have proof of the crime they’ll be the ones committing it when assaulting. Farmsteads and holdings from various other Houses from Minorev have settled the island under the Pavura's governance, and will have various problems that they wish someone would help them deal with. As a guard you’ll find quests and duties within to attend to. Your relationship with towns is unique to each, and if the reeve commends you it could come with fine rewards. Combat Banquet for Fools features pausable real-time combat. When your action bar fills, you can pause the game by opening your combat dome, and choose an action and/or target within the dome. Play as one companion at a time, but switch between them at will. The others will press on with whatever tactics you've given to them in your formation menu. If enemy combatants are too heavily defended, use a critical attack to weaken that enemy for follow up attacks for your companions, or add your attack rolls together when you unlock Rally attacks during combat to strike simultaneously! About This game is being created by two people. We've released Isle of Bxnes, Serpent in the Staglands (which is set in the same world as Banquet for Fools) and under a publisher, Mechajammer. Early Access Banquet for Fools is feature complete, we’re working on maps and content for the game over this autumn and winter. We’re essentially done with all the hard parts and only have content to work on, and thought it would be a good time to open it up for ruleset suggestions and feedback for balancing out your gameplay. It’s a single player experience so we’re not too worried about over-balancing, but want all play styles to have challenges and areas of success. Our plan is to do integer version updates of chunks of maps, and anything between will be patches/updates from suggestions or issues. You should be able to start a character at any point in Early Access and be able to continue seamlessly through updates to the end of the game. Some songs/intercessions may change, these are hardcoded, but you’ll be able to use them regardless of updates. Ruleset numbers and item numbers will certainly change over time as we fine tune everything. Due to the unique nature of creating custom spells, if spell effects have major changes you won’t be able to make a similar spell again, but your existing custom spells will still be able to be used throughout your session. We’ll let folks know if this changes in any way. In Early Access 1.0, there are currently dozens of unique creatures implemented into the island, 5 races of Vollings to play as, and over 100 unique items. Weapon types have unique animations. Skills and abilities are all fully functional along with their adjacent support systems to play, including crafting your own spells and rune images for them, and using your field kit to create projectiles like arrows, darts and elyxirs when hiking.

Iberia is home to numerous historic villages and towns, narrow streets, old churches and impressive castles. Visit the capital of Spain, Madrid, the coastal capital of Portugal, Lisboa, a wide amount of coastal cities like Málaga and Olhão, and many of the inland cities. Be an important part of the strong export economy and deliver cargo from Iberia through Europe. Iberia is delightful, here's why Travel through the Tabernas Desert, often nicknamed 'mainland Europe's only desert' Connect Iberia to the rest of Europe with shipments from its busy ports Deliver car parts and whole cars to and from the various car factories to the shipping terminals Take a rest at truck stops and gas stations crafted to closely match their real-life counterparts See landmarks of all shapes and sizes, from medieval castles to statues of historical figures Enjoy the spectacular view of the coast and even the famous 'The Rock of Gibraltar' located on the other side of the bay from the coastal city of Algeciras Immerse yourself in new ambient sound, from the subtle sound of wind through the valleys to the tweeting of birds Explore mountainous areas with a wide range of colorful rocks Visit landmarks like the Guadiana International Bridge and get a bird's-eye view on it with the viewpoint feature Unlock Iberia-specific Steam achievements Discover Iberian cities Learn more about the Iberian Peninsula Knowledge is power. You can learn all about Iberia's power sources, nature and economy below. Eco-regions From semi-arid southeastern deserts to the green coniferous forests, the Iberian Peninsula is home to a rich and very diverse ecosystem. With two dominant climate types, temperatures and weather can vary depending on where you are traveling. With Iberia being the second largest European peninsula by area, you can be sure to see a wide range of different eco-regions. Deserts Did you know many of western classics based in the wild west of America, featuring traditional cowboy shootouts and close-ups of squinting eyes (yee-haw!), were filmed in the hot and dusty deserts of Spain? Located in the south-east of Iberia and often nicknamed 'mainland Europe's only desert', you will find the Tabernas Desert, a dry but beautiful part of the Spanish mainland. This part of Iberia is the first desert climate to ever feature in Euro Truck Simulator 2; and offers a very unique contrast to the lush and green forests that dominate the rest of the continent. Whether you are just traveling through, or taking the scenic route, be sure to look out for the locations of famous movies, tumbleweed, and cowboys... because this town ain't big enough for the two of us, partner. Ports of Iberia With over 3,000 km of coastline, a majority of Iberia's largest cities and population are located near or next to the sea, and sea ports in the Iberian Peninsula play an incredibly important role within the economy. Shipping, fishing, and ocean tourism are some of the peninsula's largest industries. You will find many of these larger and smaller ports across the coastline of the peninsula. The ever-increasing demand for more products and shipping means you'll find no shortage of jobs when you are near a port. With hundreds of shipments coming and going every day, you'll be a part of connecting Iberia to the world when it comes to logistics. Car Industry Thanks to the ports across Iberia with connections to Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Atlantic, shipping across the world makes Spain and Portugal an ideal location for automobile manufacturers. Some of these operations are so large that many ports have their own dedicated car shipping terminals which are solely dedicated to the transporting of automobiles overseas. Play a vital role in delivering parts and cars to and from the various car factories throughout Europe to the shipping terminals. With millions of cars rolling off the production line each, you will have no shortage of logistic jobs in this industry. Architecture and Villages No matter where you are traveling across the peninsula, you'll be sure to see a wide array of different architecture. There are many common designs you can spot when you are driving in Iberia. Namely, the orange terracotta roofs are found on most villas, houses, and buildings; which have been created from the abundance of clay extracted from quarries in the local region. The most common type of design of buildings is designed with white walls, stone floors, and windows with shutters to help keep out the heat. Howlever, not everything about Iberia is native. From Spanish Colonial (a combination of Native American and Moorish influences) to Neoclassical architecture, it is evident to see influences from around the world found in many of Spain and Portugal's buildings and landmarks. Don't forget to slow down and take a moment to enjoy the history and beautiful architectural design that can be found across both Spain and Portugal. Iberian Energy Iberia is achieving high demand for electricity by using modern energy sources instead of using traditional ones such as coal to generate electricity. One of the more popular modern energy sources are solar panels, which uses the sun's energy (which Iberia has plenty of) as way of creating electricity. Solar panels are most effective when large amounts of them are used together on a solar farm. These areas covered by thousands of solar panels provide a sizeable chunk of Spain's and Portugal's electricity. Another source of energy typical for the Iberian Peninsula is from wind captured at turbine farms found on hilltops, in valleys, and even offshore. Truck Stops and Gas Stations Through mountains, cities, and forests, drivers often seek refuge from the sun and take the time to rest for the journey ahead at suitable rest areas and designated gas stations designed for truck drivers. With Iberia being one of the leading logistic capitals of Europe, truck stops have become commonplace across the countries of Spain and Portugal. A large majority of gas stations have been handmade which allows a variety of designs to be crafted to match their real-life counterparts as closely as possible. These rest stops also will feature other AI drivers who will pull up for fuel and for a much-needed rest in the parking area. From small country gas stations to large highway truck stops, you can relax knowing the next stop isn't too far away. Rocks and Vegetation The majority of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a much drier climate than we are used to seeing across the rest of mainland Europe. You'll see new models of trees including cypresses, palms, pines, dry shrubs, olive trees, orange trees, and cork trees, which bring a variety of vegetation that exists across Spain and Portugal. It may come as a surprise to you to find out that the peninsula is actually very rocky. You will also find that Iberia is very colourful! Much like you would see in various US states, Spain and Portugal feature different coloured soil and rocks. From red, yellow, and even sometimes grey, our team has done their best to capture the unique colours of each area across this enormous peninsula. After reading all this, we're sure you think that Iberia rocks .", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "SCS Software", "publisher": "SCS Software", "game_tag": "Simulation", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 25 GB available space (Euro Truck Simulator 2 base game)", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5-6400 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 or similar"},

Just sheer joy, I’m told. Entire civilizations, rendered down for stimulants. Stars drained dry of their power, for a decade-long soiree. Oh, to have been alive and powerful in the last days of Empire - before She-Who-Thirsts…” - Gyrthineus Roche, former Archon of The Last Blade. The Drukhari are an ancient race that fell into degeneracy and depravity, with their remnants only surviving in immense Webway cities. Though they have suppressed the psychic power of their Aeldari kin, they have replaced it with preternatural agility and rapacious cruelty. Their lighting raids from the Webway carry off wealth and captives to dark Commorragh where they suffer intensely throughout their short lives… Gameplay Mechanics Power from Pain : As pain spreads across the battlefield, Drukhari are invigorated, thriving from the suffering. Their units gain additional bonuses depending on their experience level. Corsair Outposts : The Drukhari rarely venture outside the webway, save to loot realspace resources. Their cities have a reduced growth rate, but it can be improved by controlling more outposts. Raid from the Webway : The Drukhari strike swiftly from the webway, before vanishing with their plunder. Pay influence to create temporary portals and activate webway gates to move your raiding party across the map. Raider Fortress : The Aeldari and Drukhari are forever battling over their access to the webway. Found cities on activated webway gates from which you can unleash your forces on Gladius Prime. Soul Hunger : The souls harvested by the Drukhari are an invaluable resource used for their malevolent schemes. Destroying an enemy unit rewards you with influence that can be traded for economic boosts and combat effects. Combat Drugs : The Drukhari’s foul Haemonculi render down some captives into powerful stimulants. Infantry units can pay with influence and hitpoints for temporary buffs that allow them to outperform their opponents. Betrayal Culture : Drukhari are a vicious race, and only a huge display of riches will convince them to serve—as long as it also serves their interests. Drukhari cities have lower loyalty but gathering influence grants more loyalty. Blade Artists : Blades have an omnipresent place in Drukhari culture, and each commorrite learns this from a young age. Drukhari units get bonus armour penetration in melee. Raiders tactics : When attacking a new prey world, the Drukhari attack en masse from their specially designed vehicles to land troops as close as possible to the fighting. Drukhari transports are all assault transports and Drukhari infantry units can gain combat bonuses when disembarking.

These new units are ready to demolish all the enemies’ defenses and they will give you more new strategic options. Sydonian Dragoon - Adeptus Mechanicus Fast close-combat walker unit Dragoons are tried and tested Skitarii warriors of the Adeptus Mechanicus who are given the honour of riding to war atop venerated, stilt-legged Ironstrider Engines. These fearless cavaliers thunder through enemy fire to plunge lance-first into the thick of the enemy's ranks, the pent-up energies of their taser weaponry blasting the foe back in a blazing storm of sparks. Those foolish enough to mount a counter-assault are stamped unceremoniously into the dirt. Field Ordnance Battery - Astra Militarum Large man-portable artillery pieces able to shell out enemy units at long range Ordnance teams crew some of the largest human-maneuverable weapons fielded by the Astra Militarum. On Gladius Prime, the imperial regiments exclusively use anti-infantry Bombast Cannons. This is less down to any particular military plan and more due to an Adeptus Administratum counting error in an ancient shipping manifest. Chaos Terminator - Chaos Space Marines Elite heavily armoured infantry that excels against all targets and can use powerful combi-weapons Chaos Terminators form the elite of their masters' Heretic Astartes warbands, for though they are ponderous compared to their standard Power Armour-clad comrades, nothing short of a dedicated anti-tank laser can stop a Terminator in full stride. These seasoned killers often act as the personal guards of an esteemed Champion of Chaos, enforcing the commands of their leader with pitiless efficiency and taking their pick of the spoils after each victory. Talos - Drukhari Heavy assault creature with powerful close-range weapons The Talos Pain Engine is a ghoulish melding of stitch-puckered flesh and armoured artifice, boasting tremendous resilience and a nightmarish array of weaponry. Each is the proud creation of the Drukhari Haemonculi, who employ their Talos as torture devices, surgical assistants and armoured murder machines with equal delight. Wraithlord - Craftworld Aeldari Versatile monstrous creature equipped with a vast array of weapons and able to perform powerful melee attacks Each Wraithlord is a precious component of its craftworld’s forces. Body and animating spirit alike are revered relics of a vanished age, for only the souls of the strongest Eldar heroes have the psychic presence to give life to these wraithbone shells. These long-departed nobility fight as they did in life – if they favored the press of close combat or the art of killing from afar, this will be reflected in the Wraithlord’s choice of weapon. Skorpekh Destroyer - Necrons Elite armoured close-range infantry unit Not all of the Necron Destroyer cult favour ranged weaponry or hover modifications. Rushing forward like ungainly tripods, their hyperphase limbs sweeping in a whirlwind of gore, Skorpekh Destroyers feed their need to kill whenever they are unleashed upon the battlefield. Nothing else can override the hard-wired desire to destroy all organic life that empowers these deranged Necrons. Burna Boy - Orks Anti-infantry unit equipped with a versatile flamethrower Burna Boyz are dedicated arsonists all, advancing on the foe amid gouts of billowing flame. They love nothing more than burning other peoples’ stuff, and the owners too if they can get them. These lunatics will set light to anything or anyone for the simple joy of watching them ‘do the burny dance’. They can prove utterly lethal to tightly packed or lightly armoured infantry, the roiling blasts of their burnas flushing their victims out of cover amid the sizzle of cooking flesh. Faced with more heavily armoured enemies, the Burna Boyz simply twist the apertures of their burnas to provide a tight, metal-slicing jet of blue heat. Charging into combat, Burna Boyz use these weapons to slice even incredibly resilient foes into glowing, heat-seared chunks. Arco Flagellant - Adepta Sororitas Expendable light melee infantry Arco-flagellants lope alongside faithful armies in packs, their lashlike limbs whipping back and forth as they follow their priestly masters to battle. When the enemy is sighted, they are driven into a frenzied killing rage by a potent cocktail of adrenal stimulants and neural kill-signals, whereupon they hurl themselves into battle with no thought for self-preservation or restraint. Hacking and slashing with cyber-implanted flails, pneu-mattocks and cleavers, they fight on dementedly until there is nothing left of their foes but a pile of mutilated corpses. Assault Terminator - Space Marines Heavy melee infantry unit equipped with a powerful weapon and shield The first company veterans deployed as Terminator Assault Squads forgo ranged combat, instead blasting their way with thunder hammers and deflecting enemy fire with their towering storm shields. This combination is especially effective in the close confines of boarding actions or tunnel-fighting, where a single squad can slaughter many times their number of foes without taking a single casualty. Fire Warrior Breacher - T’au Short-range infantry unit that excels in counterattacks T’au Breacher infantry specialize in brutally effective close-range assaults, clearing enemy structures and fortified positions of threats in a tight, tactical formation. They deliver sharp, shockingly sudden frontline displays of raw incendiary power that grind enemy soldiers into dust, discharging Pulse Blasters and hurling Photon Grenades until they are certain every path is clear. Maleceptor - Tyranids Synapse monstrous creature with support psychic capabilities Though blind, the rare and mighty Maleceptor is a living vessel for the Hive Mind. Warp energy spears from its eyeless cranium to vaporize anything in its path, and those with minds strong enough to survive its keening psychic screams are laid low by its powerful talons.", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "Proxy Studios", "publisher": "Proxy Studios", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 4 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or equivalent"},

Embrace decay and tyranny with new Lords, Heroes, Units, and Mechanics to enhance your campaign roster on and off the battlefield. Tamurkhan brings unique campaign mechanics to Nurgle, with a brand-new objective in the Realm of Chaos independent from the Ursun storyline, plus new Units and Heroes to help them achieve total victory. Gather Chieftains from powerful factions across the known world and become the ultimate Warlord of Nurgle as Tamurkhan. One of the first to flock to Tamurkhan’s banner, the new Legendary Hero Kayzk the Befouled joins the Maggot Lord’s side. The Chaos Lord of Nurgle and Chaos Sorcerer of Nurgle reinforce the Grandfather’s throng as new Lord and Hero choices respectively. 5 new units and 3 regiments of renown join the forces of Nurgle, including the mutated Plague Ogres and monstrous Toad Dragons. TAMURKHAN: THE MAGGOT LORD Tamurkhan, the Maggot Lord and Champion of Nurgle, is one of the greatest Chaos warlords to ever afflict the known world. A mighty leader to some, and a bloated corpse-worm to others, those that stand against Tamurkhan quickly fall under the banner of this bringer of desolation. As a hard-hitting tank with the strength of an Ogre and the vigour of Nurgle’s greatest combatants, Tamurkhan rides into battle atop his unique Toad Dragon, Bubebolos, to unleash rot on any that dare oppose the Warlord. Tamurkhan’s crusade across the land is not merely one of destruction or decay, for he amasses a horde of heroic characters as he goes, absorbing the many strengths of those that could not defeat him. These heroic characters, Chieftains, are added to his ever-growing empire once Tamurkhan has displayed his true dominating power, granting the Maggot Lord a suite of champions and warriors for use in his grand crusade. With enough devoted Chieftains under his wing, Tamurkhan can pursue ultimate victory.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 6 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 120 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " 3.4GHz Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD Ryzen CPU equivalent"},

Gazing at the summer scenery, it seemed as if the girl was left behind in a world that she had wandered into. At a school adrift in the distance, there lived three girls who had lost their memories.

Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions. All of time and space are yours to explore – cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky – stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae – are yours to explore at the press of a button. Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons – create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others. With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless. SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities: Astronomy All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems. Controls You are free to move around the universe – travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as \"click and go\", as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls. Graphics Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer's GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets. Physics Realistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics. Virtual reality SpaceEngine supports Oculus (via native library) and SteamVR (HTC Vive, Valve Index, WMR and other headsets). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR. Sound Original background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development. Tools Built-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in “Wiki” info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools. Multi-language support Currently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Catalan, Chinese, Japanese, Korean languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game. Modding SpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships.

It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time. In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish. Survival The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts. Kriegsmarine career During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies. Accurate simulation Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Deep Water Studio", "publisher": "Deep Water Studio", "game_tag": "Simulation", "minimum_ram": " 6 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 71 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Core i3 3.1 GHz or AMD Phenom II X3 2.8 GHz"},

Dawn actually believes she is a wild cat. And plans on escaping as soon as she gets the chance. Dawn has second thoughts when she meets new owner Olive, a lonely older Aussie mourning the disappearance of her beloved furry companion. Together Dawn and Olive develop an intimate friendship, as two broken hearts mend one another and learn to beat as one. ❤️ Everything changes when Olive falls ill, and a stray copycat steals Dawn’s place in the home—forcing Dawn onto the streets.

Chart a path to victory for your people by developing new advanced technologies and engineering projects and negotiating with the global community in the World Congress on critical issues. The choices you make in the game will influence the world ecosystem and could impact the future of the entire planet. Natural disasters like floods, storms, and volcanoes can pillage or destroy your Improvements and Districts – but they may also refresh and enrich the lands after they pass. In addition to these new systems, Civilization VI: Gathering Storm introduces eight new civilizations and nine new leaders. Seven new world wonders can be constructed, as well as a variety of new units, districts, buildings, and improvements. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sand storms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts. POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES Strategic resources play an additional role in Gathering Storm . These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you’ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world’s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. ENGINEERING PROJECTS Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads.

Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as a total of nine unique units, four unique buildings, three unique improvements, two unique districts and one unique governor. NEW SCENARIOS The Black Death: The Black Death ravaged Europe and western Asia in the mid-14th century, killing a greater share of the population than any other event in world history. The pandemic killed millions, ruined economies, upended political dynasties and transformed the face of the Western world. Your task is to lead your nation through the calamity: keep your population alive, your economy strong, and your faith unshaken amidst a world of terror and desperation. War Machine: At the outset of WWI, the German Imperial Army had a daring plan: invade neutral Belgium and then rush the French heartland before they could mobilize to resist. If successful, the German forces would capture Paris within a month and end their resistance forever. In counter, the French command prepared Plan 17, an all-out onslaught designed to meet and stop a German offensive. When war was declared, both armies swung into motion and set up one of the most incredible and shocking military campaigns in world history. In this multiplayer scenario, players take the side of one of these two great powers at this same precipice. As Germany, your task is to capture Paris. As France, your task is to prevent its capture.

The game features two core mechanics: the construction and designing of the school and managing the dynamics of students and teachers. Each student has unique interests and aspirations, making your role as headmaster more complex. Balancing factors like your school's reputation, satisfying students' basic needs, overseeing academic pressure, and managing aspects like clothing, food, and travel provide an immersive and challenging experience. Aside from the usual responsibilities of a headmaster, you are also tasked with managing various issues that originate outside the school, including mysterious dangers and potential threats that might cause things to go bananas! The architectural design of the school is a blank canvas for the player. With the freedom to plan and construct various functional facilities and access to hundreds of educational equipment, you define your institution's aesthetic and practical landscape. Don't limit yourself to horizontal expansion - think vertically by constructing multi-story buildings for more innovative developments or even eccentric structures! The fate of teachers and students lies in your hands. The recruitment process, teaching methodologies, and personal growth of teachers and students rest on your decisions. Enhancing the skills of your teachers opens up opportunities for them in different roles. You can influence student morale and academic performance by offering elective courses, thereby shaping their future life paths. The management of school discipline is another crucial responsibility. Be mindful of the impact of school facilities on student morale, and beware of signs of student distress. Overeating in the canteen could lead to weight gain, while an increase in eyeglass usage could signal excessive stress. Proper access to sanitary facilities is vital, as a lack thereof may lead to widespread anxiety and misuse of the school premises. To maintain discipline, monitor for contraband among students and establish an effective punishment system. Handling real-time crises such as truancy, bullying, and questioning also falls within your responsibilities. Fostering a balanced school environment through field days, morning exercises, school club activities and various events could help students regulate their emotions.

Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.

It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. INVESTIGATE THE ZONE The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \"the pinnacle of an entire genre\". THE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK’s Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all! In THE LONG DARK , you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE. Included with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK , Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. The game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. Explore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle. Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Additional Challenges include: Hopeless Rescue, Nomad, Archivist, As the Dead Sleep, and Escape the Darkwalker. Included in THE LONG DARK The episodic story-mode for THE LONG DARK, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episode Five is in development, and is slated for release at a later date. This will bring the WINTERMUTE storyline to its conclusion. The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free when it is released. Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? NOTE: Unlike Survival Mode, WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. You can save your progress as you play. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. In addition to releasing the remaining episode of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode with limited free updates alongside our paid DLC Expansion Pass, TALES FROM THE FAR TERRITORY. This is on top of the over 100 updates we have made to the game over the past 8 years of open development. Keep in mind that your purchase of THE LONG DARK entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE without extra charge.

Under your direction and guidance, she can amass more and more devoted listeners/obsessed fans, turning her into a super-popular streamer.– and thus allowing you to squeeze stupid amounts of Super Chat out of her donation-happy otaku followers. ■Gotta get topics for streaming! Let's do all kinds of things from afternoon to evening to find out hot topics for streaming. Sometimes you just need to take a little break because streaming can be stressful. Take Ame on dates, serve her up a little bit of naughtiness once in awhile, provide her with a little something-something to take the edge off when she needs to release some pent-up stress, and use social media to grumble about  to help keep her happy and mentally healthy. But be careful. Depending on your actions, she might  increase her \"sickness level\" and be swallowed by the darkness of the Internet! *NOTE: This is a perfectly wholesome game, containing absolutely no explicit sexual references or expressions nor illegal substances. For real! You can see the results of your daily actions and behavior via social media, where Ame-chan will use both public and private accounts to talk about you. People have a tendency to act supportive and friendly on the outside, while talking loads of smack and spreading rumors privately. ■You'll get a variety of messages every day! Let's reply back to them with stickers. Ignoring messages is not a human thing to do. Don't make her angry. You’ll sometimes receive long-winded, tedious criticisms and insults, but that’s just par for the course when dealing with a cute girl streaming on the internet. Be sure to take proper care of her. ■The game features multiple endings! Your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head.

With deliberate, calculated and unforgiving gameplay, GROUND BRANCH aims to be the true rebirth of the tactical realism genre of the late '90s and early 2000s. Powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, GB puts the \"tactical\" back in \"tactical shooter\"—no compromises. ▶ TRUE FIRST PERSON GROUND BRANCH's unique True First-Person System improves world immersion and awareness of your surroundings, providing zero disconnect between your view and your character's physical presence in the environment. See your foot sticking out of cover? Better tuck it in—enemies may be able to see it (and shoot it) too, but only if their line of sight and muzzle are verifiably unobstructed. Cameras are placed at the character's eyes and bullets originate from the weapon's muzzle. In GROUND BRANCH, what you see is what you get. A minimal HUD with multiple optional elements ensures that vital information is available, but never a constant obstacle to either immersion or your field of view. ▶ UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMIZATION Say goodbye to pre-defined kits and fully customize your character and gear from basic appearance and outfit to in-depth vest and weapon platform customization, down to individual pouch and attachment placement. What you bring to your mission is determined only by your loadout choice, with realistic consequences: With the upcoming encumbrance and stamina system, too much equipment will impact your character's speed and performance; place a scope too forward on the rail and your sight picture will be too small; bring a long rifle into CQB and weapon collision may prove a hindrance. Forget unlocks, microtransactions and loot boxes. Ground Branch operators get all the right tools for the job straight away—courtesy of the Agency. ▶ OPERATE, COOPERATE Whether in 8-player co-op or 8v8 adversarial game modes, GROUND BRANCH's unforgiving gameplay makes careful and calculated teamwork essential. Gather your teammates and practice in full-featured training areas, including shooting ranges with dynamic targets and customizable killhouses. Integrated VOIP with both 3D positional voice and radio ensures full communication capabilities with no need for third-party software. Text chat and pre-recorded voice messages ( commo rose -style) also available for the mic-less and the shy. Prefer single-player? Missions with friendly A.I. and a full command system are fully planned. ▶ BE IN FULL CONTROL In the tactical shooter realm, movement and weapon handling are king. Take full control of your character with standing, crouching and ( soon! ) prone stances—each with multiple movement speeds—as well as unique weapon postures (including low- and high-ready), leaning and stepping out, free-look (head movement independent from aim), customizable and optional free-aim (dead zone), dedicated mouse sensitivity sliders for point-shooting/unmagnified/magnified aiming, and all-around highly configurable key bindings. You can also choose between speed reloads (drop magazine) and tactical reloads (retain current magazine) on the fly. ▶ ADDITIONAL FEATURES ☑️ = FULLY or PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ⏳ = PLANNED/UPCOMING Missions ⏳ GROUND BRANCH's unique \"campaign\" format will deliver smaller, more localized sets of missions based around global hotspots, with a centralized intelligence interface to monitor them and receive new mission orders over time. The choices you make along the way may affect future engagements. ☑️ Based on unique environments all over the world, the non-linear mission and map designs offer multiple entry points and open-ended outcomes. ☑️ Enemies are spawned at mission start, with a degree of randomization to quantity and location. No \"monster closets\" or magic enemy spawns based on player location or mission progress. Multiplayer ☑️ Ready Room: A physical multiplayer lobby where you can plan your approach, see your teammates' loadouts, test weapon configurations on a firing range and jointly select insertion points. ☑️ Full and 100% free dedicated server support. Host a server wherever you want! ☑️ Unit patches that can be attached to your character's sleeves and gear. ⏳ Full support for MP ladders. ☑️ After-action review (AAR) following each mission/round. ☑️ Server-side options. Miscellaneous ⏳ Full mod support. ☑️ No item unlocking, hit markers, kill confirmations or score pop-ups. ⏳ Weapon bracing/supporting. ☑️ Varied arsenal: Multiple handguns, submachine guns, carbines, assault and battle rifles, machine guns, DMRs, sniper rifles and explosives to choose from, with selectable ammunition type (e.g. full metal jacket, hollow point or subsonic rounds, smoke grenade color etc.). ☑️ Map variation: In addition to day and night versions as well as weather variation, maps have small details that can change between rounds, such as doors and windows that may be open, closed or blocked. ☑️ Unlimited loadout save slots. ☑️ Item sharing/dropping/pickups. ☑️ Accurate ballistics with penetration, bullet drop and stopping power simulation. ⏳ No regenerating health or health packs: Administer first aid to non-lethal injuries for reduced combat effectiveness. ⏳ Location damage model: Expect visible injuries and consequences, such as limping, reduced arm function, and/or hits to stamina and accuracy. Players immobilized from a non-lethal injury can stay in the fight. ⏳ Carry teammates to safety to administer first aid—or to safely recover their ammo, gear, cargo or body if they are no longer alive. ☑️ Appropriate and realistic playable female characters. ☑️ Partial controller support (configurable).", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "BlackFoot Studios", "publisher": "BlackFoot Studios", "game_tag": "Tactical", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 30 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5-2500K / AMD FX-8350"},

Born in the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park, you learned the ways of the wolf in your family pack. Now you are venturing out on your own — to explore, hunt, find a mate, establish territory, and raise your own family. EMBARK ON A QUEST FOR SURVIVAL Your quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain. Here you must test your hunting skills against elk, moose, and mule deer. Once you're a skilled hunter, you can seek out another wolf to become your mate. Then, together, you venture to Slough Creek, cutting through the the mountains north of the Lamar Valley, to establish a territory and den site and raise a litter of pups. You must feed them, play with them, protect them from deadly competitors, and take them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Can your little family pack succeed? EXPERIENCE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK Explore WolfQuest's realistic recreation of the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park — \"the Serengeti of North America\" — where herds of elk and other ungulates roam the sagebrush steppe grasslands, alpine forests, and magnificent high ridges. But watch out for packs of stranger wolves, who patrol their territories and don't look kindly on intruders. The wilderness brims with other dangers as well — grizzly bears, cougars, and coyotes — who all vie with you for territory and food. REALISTIC ECOLOGY AND GAMEPLAY WolfQuest: Anniversary Edition raises the bar for realistic and accurate eco-simulation gameplay: Herds of elk roam the land in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, beavers, and other prey. Other wolf packs maintain and defend their territory against intruders -- like you. Grizzlies, cougars, coyotes, and other predators challenge you over your kills -- and protect theirs. Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions allow you to choose a suitable mate. Adorable wolf pups who play with each other and with your wolf and mate. Vast wilderness maps (nearly 50 square kilometers) depict Yellowstone's Northern Range. Innovative Age Perks system models the arc of life (and death) of a wild wolf. In Ironwolf mode (optional), live life on the edge: your first death is your last. Dynamic day/night, weather, and seasons immerse you in the wilderness. Over 80 achievements, plus collectible objects. MULTIPLAYER! Create a public game open to everyone or a private game for friends only. Co-op multiplayer: Raise your pups together! Co-op mission: Claim and maintain territory against rival wolf packs. Our science advisors include some of the top wolf biologists in the world today, who help us keep WolfQuest accurate to real wolf biology and behavior. MORE FEATURES COMING DURING EARLY ACCESS! The WolfQuest Saga will continue the story of the pack! Leave your summering spot and follow the elk herds through the seasons, helping your pups learn how to hunt as they grow to adulthood. Then as the years roll by, raise a new litter of pups, with your yearlings helping before they disperse. (Learn more in the pinned post in Community Hub Discussions, \"THE WOLFQUEST SAGA: Where No WolfQuest Has Gone Before.\") As the years go by, move your pack to other Yellowstone maps anytime during fall or winter.

A gripping real-time campaign awaits you on a detailed 3d map where you can build your army and navy, construct military infrastructure, and fully command your armies on a regimental level. If you want even more action you can fully zoom-in and fight massive battles on a battalion level. Fight in real-time on the global map with regiments and naval squadrons. Move your General to gain tactical control of the situation in a minimal way. The presence of the General makes it possible to control the troops or ships directly on the map, actively use maneuvers, cut supply routes, utilize different types of terrain, and flank with cavalry. The battles can be fought with more detail and full tactical control by zooming-in further on the map. MASSIVE BATTLES If you choose to fight battles with full tactical control, the regiments become divided into smaller battalions allowing you the command of hundreds of units in real-time, creating a dazzling and realistic combat experience of the historical period. Troops are positioned in a landscape according to the placement they had on the map at the given time. Some will engage the enemy immediately, others can be re-positioned in deployment zones, while those which were further away may join later as reinforcements. DELAYED REPORTING Realistic reconnaissance is simulated, making messages the basis of military intelligence and battle maneuvering. Messages can be delayed or be intercepted by the enemy, resulting in your orders not reaching your troops in time or rendering communication with your distant territories impossible. BUILD YOUR ARMY AND FLEET You will need a strong army and navy to win the war. Form infantry regiments, cavalry squadrons, and fleets. Assign the best officers and equip units with the strongest weapons to increase their power. You will have to choose how best to manage your recruits - create new units or replenish casualties?  Such decisions may have a huge impact on the course of war. MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE Lead your troops to victory. Develop regions that provide food, weapons, and ammunition for your army and navy. Build military structures to train special recruits or host your army during the harsh winter.  Build infrastructure to raise supplies and plan supply routes that reach your armies while they are fighting. SUPPLY YOUR TROOPS Armies or Fleets cannot be maintained without an effective industrial base. Produce rifles, cannons, and build ships. A single shot needs powder and a bullet. War requires tons of powder and thousands of bullets. Organize and prioritize the production chain to fulfill your army's requirements. DEVELOP YOUR HEADQUARTERS Design the structure of the army in full detail, by creating and organizing army departments which are essential for a functional army. Manage their funds and allocate the right person for each department to directly influence the army’s efficiency in combat, intelligence and supply management. As the department’s officers gain experience they become more effective not only in their main role but also in researching new weapons, tactics and inventing methods that will progressively further enhance your army.", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "Game-Labs", "publisher": "Game-Labs", "game_tag": "Grand Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 12 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or AMD equivalent"},

Introducing two rival Legendary Lords from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, each with their own objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle, for use in both the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns, and custom/multiplayer battles. Two richly themed new Legendary Lords lead their own factions: Markus Wulfhart leads the Huntsmarshal’s Expedition (Empire), and Nakai The Wanderer leads the Spirit of the Jungle Each Legendary Lord brings their own unique faction mechanics, quest-chains, legendary items, skill-trees and campaign narrative Devastating new ranged units, mobile gunpowder batteries and fabled Hunter Heroes for the Huntsmarshal’s Expedition Towering new Dread Saurians, the largest beasts to walk the world of Total War: WARHAMMER, plus new Kroxigors, Razordons and Rites for Spirit of the Jungle New Regiments of Renown to unlock, recruit and field Background Fearless, charismatic, daring: these are but a few of the epithets bestowed upon Markus Wulfhart, the Huntsmarshal of Emperor Karl Franz. With his band of ruthless trackers, scouts, hunters and sharpshooters, who better to dispatch to the steaming jungles of Lustria, in order to plant the flag and further Imperial interests? And if some Big Game should wander into the crosshairs, why, all the better… But the jungle does not sleep. Nakai The Wanderer, revered Kroxigor of the first-spawning, is a living legend among the Lizardmen. Wandering the jungles of Lustria since the destruction of his home-city of Tlanxla during the Great Catastrophe, he follows where the Great Plan wills him. Now Lustria is at threat from usurpers once more. Nakai will rally the Sacred Kroxigors, and rouse the Dread Saurians from their ageless slumber – the Old Ones demand it! Markus Wulfhart (The Huntsmarshal’s Expedition) Unique faction mechanics: Emperor’s Mandate As Markus Wulfhart expands Imperial interests in Lustria, his stature in the eyes of the Emperor grows. As a result, he receives a broadening range of increasingly advanced Empire units to aid in his expedition. As new territory is captured, his building options also diversify. In the Eye of the Vortex campaign, Markus will ultimately face the Spirit of the Jungle himself, Nakai the Wanderer, to decide who holds dominion over the jungles of Lustria. Wulfhart’s campaign progress is measured by how effectively he fulfils the Emperor’s Mandate. Expansion, successful military operations and other campaign activities increase his acclaim, which is tracked on the Emperor’s Mandate bar. The Emperor’s Mandate also dictates the quality of units available to Wulfhart via the Imperial Supplies system, which dispatches better units for him to recruit from time to time. As the Mandate bar fills, he will also unlock bonuses to further improve these units, plus new recruitment buildings. In the Eye of the Vortex campaign, filling the Emperor’s Mandate bar will cause Nakai the Wanderer to issue a final, do-or-die challenge to Markus Wulfhart – a call to battle that will become the stuff of legend! Hostility The lands beyond the Empire are inimical to man, and Wulfhart’s actions will not go unnoticed. While defeating the local inhabitants improves Wulfhart’s Imperial standing and increases his supply of fresh troops, it also enrages Lustria’s native denizens… Wulfhart’s Hostility rating reflects the current level of Lustria’s retaliation against his military activities. Aggressive activities, such as military actions and raiding, can raise Hostility through five levels. Conversely, a more passive approach to the campaign will cause Hostility to fall. Each Hostility level has a negative effect on Wulfhart’s campaign, but is also a measure of his aggression against the Lizardmen. As he ascends through the Hostility levels, reinforcements are dispatched more frequently via the Imperial Supplies system. The strength of these reinforcements is still dictated by the Emperor’s Mandate bar. When peak Hostility is reached, a Lizardmen task-force is dispatched with the aim of defeating Wulfhart. He will instantly receive an Imperial Supplies drop and will need to survive sustained assault for a number of turns before the hostility bar resets. Wulfhart’s Hunters Scattered throughout Lustria are four of the finest Hunters that ever lived. Wulfhart may attempt to track them down and acquire their services to aid in the expedition’s success, and subsequently developing each Hunter’s unique attributes and learning the tales of their past deeds. Wulfhart can search for the four Hunters in the Jungles of Lustria by completing special missions. The Hunters each have bespoke stories which are uncovered through unique missions. Completing these missions will reward them with new traits and powerful abilities. The Hunters are not required to complete Wulfhart's narrative Vortex campaign, but bring major benefits to the Huntsmarshal’s Expedition. Jorek Grimm is a brilliant Master Engineer. Shunned for his eccentric ideas, he has struck out alone to seek his fortune in Lustria… Rodrik L'Anguille was once a renowned Paladin. Disgraced and exiled however, he is haunted by a past he cannot escape… Hertwig Van Hal, a skilled physician and Witch Hunter, has travelled far from home on his quest for ultimate vengeance… Kalara of Wydrioth, the eminent Waystalker, has traded the forests of Avelorn for the jungles of Lustria in pursuit of redemption… New units and characters: Markus Wulfhart In battle, Wulfhart is a ranged combatant with a powerful armour-piercing bow which deals bonus damage to large targets. Coupled with Vanguard Deployment, Stalk, a 360-degree fire-arc and immune to psychology, he has a well-deserved reputation as the ultimate monster hunter. In keeping with his reputation, Markus Wulfhart has a significant ambush defence and ambush success chance, and a large upkeep reduction to Huntsmen and Archers in his army. Huntsman General (Lord) Following Wulfhart’s example, his Huntsman Generals have Vanguard Deployment, Stalk, a 360-degree fire-arc are immune to psychology, and deal bonus damage against large targets. Their Fire Arrow capabilities mean they synergise well with Bright Wizards, and they grant reload-rate bonuses to other Imperial missile units. Archers The backbone of Wulfhart’s hunting-parties, these Imperial archers are inexpensive, plentiful, quick to fire, and are great at soaking enemy formations with ranged damage. Their loose formation enables them to trade fire with other ranged units at a profit. Deathjacks (Archers – Regiments of Renown) These elite archers also have Stalk, Snipe and Vanguard Deployment, enabling them to strike fast, strike first, and remain hidden from view. If well-screened, they can continue to fire without fear of discovery or ranged retaliation. Huntsmen: Only the finest archers ascend to the rank of Huntsmen. Well-drilled and versatile, they have Vanguard Deployment and Stalk, can fire while moving, have a greater range than standard Archers, enjoy a good degree of accuracy, and deal bonus damage to large targets. White Wolves (Huntsmen – Regiment of Renown) Few face the White Wolves and live to tell of it. These elite Huntsmen match their bow-skills with ruthless melee capabilities, granting them a useful hybrid role. Alongside their Hunter attributes, they also Encourage nearby friendlies and are Immune to Psychology. War Wagon These mobile armoured wagons are packed with six riflemen, each armed with an armour-piercing Outrider rifle. Slower than standard missile cavalry but far more resilient, they can fire while moving and in all directions, and reposition to place their fusillades precisely where required. In a pinch, they can also be used as chariots and charged into lighter or weakened enemy units. War Wagon (Mortar) These mobile artillery pieces may carry less ammo than standard mortars, but more than make up for it by being able to stay one step ahead of melee combatants, repositioning when threatened to set up a new base-of-fire and bombard the foe afresh. The Black Lions (War Wagon - Helblaster Volley Gun – Regiment of Renown) The ultimate unit in The Expedition’s armoury, The Black Lion is a devastating mobile light artillery piece. While shorter ranged than a standard Helblaster Volley Gun, it can pump rounds into approaching troops until the last second, then reposition to avoid getting caught in melee. Nakai the Wanderer (Spirit of the Jungle) Unique faction mechanics: New Horde mechanics Nakai’s faction, the Spirit of the Jungle, offers a unique variation on Horde gameplay. Each army in his faction, when placed in the Encampment stance, may develop its settlement infrastructure much as a standard settlement would. That infrastructure is preserved when the horde moves off, and may be further developed during future periods of Encampment. If a horde is destroyed in battle, all its infrastructure is lost along with the army. However, only Nakai’s personal horde can unlock units for recruitment. Other hordes in his faction may then recruit unit types Nakai has unlocked using the Global Recruitment option. These ‘minor’ hordes still have their own infrastructure and building trees, though some of these are focused on reducing Global Recruitment times rather than unlocking units. Defence of the Great Plan The Great Plan of the Old Ones lies in a delicate balance. Many look to disrupt it, but none defend it as devoutly as Nakai the Wanderer. Nakai begins play with a vassal faction called the Defenders of the Great Plan – the caretakers of the great Temple Cities. When one of Nakai’s armies captures a region, it may be gifted to the Defenders. When a region is gifted thus, Nakai must choose which Old One that region’s temple should be dedicated to. As more temples are dedicated to a specific Old One, the more powerful the rewards bestowed upon Nakai and his faction. These temples generate a unique resource called Old Ones' Favour. Nakai may expend this Favour to access Blessed Spawnings units, or to recruit Lords at much higher ranks. Warmblood Invaders The avaricious warmbloods look to pillage the temple cities of Lustria for profit. These invaders lurk throughout the jungles; they must be tracked and confronted with cold-blooded ferocity for the Great Plan to remain intact and unimpaired! In the Eye of the Vortex campaign, Nakai must fight to keep Lustria in the rightful hands of the Lizardmen. Several Empire colonies have been established, and each is encroaching on the jungle. They must be dealt with! Four extremely dangerous Hunters co-ordinate the efforts of the warmbloods. Hunt them down to draw out their leader, then defeat them all in a final, epic confrontation! Unique Rites Nakai has a selection of new Rites focused around his units, faction mechanics and campaign focus. Rite of Alleigance: Performing this Rite brings Nakai to the attention of the Old Ones, increasing his vassal income and all his Hordes' replenishment rates. Rite of Rebirth: this Rite increases the growth rate for Hordes in Nakai’s faction, reduces construction costs, and reduces unit recruitment and upkeep costs factionwide. Rite of Mastery: This Rite increases the recruitment rank of Kroxigors, Kroxigor Ancients and Sacred Kroxigors, while improving their weapon strength and armour. New units and characters: Nakai the Wanderer With high armour, health, melee attack and weapon strength, Nakai is a powerful brawler, well-suited to extended melee. He also grants bonus melee defence to, and reduces the recruitment and upkeep costs, of Kroxigors and Sacred Kroxigors in his army. Nakai also has a number of new support abilities in battle, further cementing his role as the centrepiece of battle: Miasma of Despair: speed, vigour and leadership area-effect debuff Primal Roar: Increases Nakai’s physical resistance and melee attack, and grants Rampage to allies Golden Tributes: Perfect Vigour for allies in range Ancient Kroxigors These well-armoured, hard hitting, anti-infantry specialists are cast in the mould of Nakai himself, and well-suited to extended melee engagements. Feral Dread Saurian If you thought Carnosaurs the apex-predators of Lustria, think again. With breathtaking weapon-damage and high armour, these towering walls of teeth and fury are versatile, elite-killing, melee behemoths, and are subject to Rampage. Dread Saurian (Howdah) Somewhat tamer than their feral cousins, though no less capable, these titanic beasts are ridden into battle by Skink skirmishers, and do not rampage. Combining their terrifying melee power with four giant blowpipes and eight skinks hurling poisoned javelins, it is the ultimate multirole unit. Shredder of Lustria (Dread Saurian Howdah – Regiment of Renown) With rank nine stats, Encourage, and a passive hex aura reducing nearby enemy leadership, The Shredder of Lustria is truly a one-unit army – and comes with a pricetag to match. Sacred Kroxigors These versatile and hard-hitting monstrous infantry are great all-rounders. With high weapon-strength and magical attacks, they can plough through against a greater variety of foes than standard Kroxigors. Cohort of Huatl (Sacred Kroxigors – Regiment of Renown) The Cohort of Huatl is a top-tier monstrous infantry unit. Building on the Sacred Kroxigors’ capabilities with additional armour-sundering attacks and bonus physical resistance, they synergise well in the field with Skinks and Saurus Warriors. Razordon Hunting Pack Filling the air with deadly grapeshot-style volleys of armour-piercing fire, Razordon Hunting Packs are potent – and mobile – armoured infantry hunters. Amaxon Barbs (Razordons – Regiment of Renown) Dealing poison damage, and heavily scaled for enhanced missile resistance, these Razordons are pinpoint shooters and make top-notch skirmishers.

EXPERIENCE THE WORLD OF NAVE From the bustling cities of a once-great empire to gloomy volcanic wastelands, frigid ice-capped mountain peaks to sweltering hot jungles full of beasts stalking through the undergrowth, fog-blanketed bamboo forests to dark caverns unexplored for centuries—the world of Mortal Online 2 is huge and brimming with creatures, secrets, resources, and opportunity. WHO WILL YOU BE? With four races and the option to mix multiple bloodlines within each race, you can forge a character perfectly tailored to your intentions.

Each leads their own faction and features new characters, units, unique gameplay mechanics and narrative objectives. The wild energies of the Great Vortex have torn a rift in the Dreaming Woods. Could this form the site of a Daemonic invasion? Sensing great peril, Queen Ariel of Athel Loren dispatches her trusted emissaries, the Sisters of Twilight, to prepare the way for a ritual of closure. Catching wind of Ariel’s plan, Throt the Unclean scents opportunity. If he can defeat the Sisters and capture the Elven queen while she is vulnerable, perhaps he can harness her essence and cure the eternal pangs of starvation caused by his Warpstone-infused metabolism… Legendary lords Wood Elves: The Sisters of Twilight Once a single being, divided into siblings by The Weave, Naestra and Arahan are two sides of the same coin. They work together in the service of queen Ariel, marshalling the woodland warriors at her command, and cannot be slain unless both fall in battle. The Twilight Sisters must prepare the glade for Ariel’s arrival and protect her as she performs the ritual. Forge of Daith: Daith, the master smith of Vaul’s Anvil, will forge and upgrade unique items for the Sister of Twilight.

She is a powerful spellcaster who is more than capable in melee combat too Spellweaver: Spellcaster Lord who can be recruited to wield the Lores of Life/Beasts/Shadow/Dark/High magic Zoats: Powerful Monstrous Beasts who have access to bound Lore of Life spells Great Stag Knights: heavy Wood Elf cavalry used to penetrate infantry lines and decimate lighter cavalry Bladesingers: Elite, sword-wielding Wardancers Regiments of Renown: Wraiths of the Frozen Heart (Dryads): Particularly effective for preventing cavalry from cycle charging, or stopping a missile unit from retreating. Lost Sylvan Knights (Great Stag Knights): Equipped with significant physical resistance. Enigmas of Ghyran (Zoats): Elite Zoats with more powerful spells from the Lore of Life. Skaven: Throt the Unclean An eternal hunger gnaws at Throt, the Master Mutator of Clan Moulder. A lifetime of auto-experimentation has made him powerful, but his vastly enhanced metabolism means he must feed constantly to maintain himself. He is hell-bent on reducing the Wood Elf queen to a magical pulp, which he will consume to satiate himself at long last. The Flesh Laboratory: Moulding muscle and bone like living clay, Throt can use his Flesh Laboratory to fashion hideous new abominations for the battlefield. Numerous augmentations can be stacked to make existing units perform in horrifying new ways, but flesh can only bear so much torment before the subject becomes unstable. Even such aberrations have a use though, as they can be rendered down for valuable materials. More Growth Juice for the vats, Yes-yes! Units: Ghoritch: A former general of Archaon the Everchosen, once ignored his commander’s orders and was sent to Hell Pit as punishment. There Throt transplanted his brain into the body of a Rat Ogre, creating an aberration of incredible speed, strength and intelligence. Ghoritch is recruitable as a Legendary Hero.

The Great Plains is an area that stretches more than eighteen hundred miles from north to south of North America and more than five hundred miles from east to west. Million Dollar Highway Offering views of mountains, valleys and gorges, the Million Dollar Highway is a road like no other. Stretching for around 25 miles (40 km) on the U.S. Highway 550, it has been said that it's one of the nation’s most spectacular drives. The highway delivers jaw-dropping vistas and stunning backdrops on its winding and often dangerous road. So why is this stretch of road named the Million Dollar Highway? There are several stories including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build it and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore. Industries Speaking about gold, the state is known for its gold mine located near Colorado Springs where you can haul important mining equipment and waste rock to and from the mining site. Colorado is also home to a variety of bottling plants, each producing and distributing an assortment of different beverages which drivers can deliver to locations across the States. Being a state that promotes its natural beauty, Colorado is always looking at ways of using clean energy to protect the environment. With unique parts and equipment always on the move from the number one wind turbine factory in the USA to wind farms across the States, we hope you will be a BIG fan of this industry.

From hay bales to farming equipment, truckers will be the backbone of making sure this important and large industry in Cowowado keeps on moo-vin' ! One of the largest contributors to the local economy is Denver International Airport. Drivers can expect to see lots of details around the airport including Denver's famous horse statue.

Cities Nicknamed the Mile High City, Denver features accurate representations of famous landmarks and industries for drivers to discover and deliver cargo to. Denver will also feature a realistic road network, including the famous \"mousetrap intersection\", the interchange of I-25 and I-70, which is best known for its spaghetti-like design. Located at the foot of Pikes Peak, you'll find the city of Colorado Springs, the state's 2nd most populous city. Colorado Springs is known for its many one-of-a-kind attractions, the most iconic being the city's Garden of the Gods Park, a National Natural Landmark.

Each leads their own faction and features new characters, units, unique gameplay mechanics and narrative objectives. Formed of living bronze, the rage-filled Doombull Taurox is nigh-on invincible – save for one area on his gargantuan neck. The Chaos gods whisper to him of a ritual that can eliminate this weakness, but the promises of the ruinous powers are seldom what they seem… Meanwhile, Oxyotl, the revered Chameleon Skink and master of stealth, scents the machinations of Chaos and rallies his cohorts. Taurox must be stopped at all costs, lest a new tide of Chaos sweeps the world. When the Silence meets the Fury in a final confrontation, who will prevail? Beastmen: Taurox After embarking on a bloody rampage through Talabecland, Taurox was rewarded by the dark gods with a body of brass… and still, he thirsts for slaughter! As he wins battles, Taurox gains Momentum, and his army can replenish action points to fight and fight again. The longer his kill-streak continues, the greater the gifts bestowed upon him by the ruinous powers. He and his Beastmen hordes will ultimately need to locate the Heart of the Dark, where he will face Oxyotl in a final, decisive battle. New Beastmen units Doombull Lord: Doombulls are the most powerful of the Minotaurs. Only the most ferocious ascend to the rank of general to lead armies of their own into battle. Wargor Hero: Brutal melee warriors in their own right, Wargor Heroes can be recruited to buff other Beastmen units in battle with their support abilities. Tuskgor Chariot: high-mass chariots drawn by ravening Tuskgors, these vehicles cause massive impact damage and disrupt enemy units they crash into. Ghorgon: These four-armed, ox-headed creatures have evolved to become monstrous in size. They are adept at fighting other large units and can regenerate health in battle. Jabberslythe: A sickening fusion of toad, sludge-drake and many-limbed insect, the Jabberslythe is a top-tier anti-infantry monster with powerful AoE damage vortex, poison attacks and a passive leadership debuff. New Regiments of Renown The Groghooves of Wolf’s Run: Centigors with throwing axes which come with poison attacks as well as health regeneration via their Drunken Bravado passive ability. The Vorbergland Broodmother: A legendary Jabberslythe that can sunder armour with regular attacks as well as via a powerful armour-piercing vortex. The Bloodbrute Behemoth: A legendary Ghorgon which deals more damage the lower an enemy’s health is, making it the perfect monster-slayer. Lizardmen: Oxyotl A chameleon Skink of high renown, Oxyotl has a long history of fighting – and succeeding against – the otherworldly forces of Chaos. His prescience enables him to detect where the forces of chaos will strike next and, utilising the network of lost Silent Sanctums across the world only he can capture and develop, Oxyotl can choose which threats to tackle, and reap the rewards of victory. Oxyotl can instantly travel between his capitol, his unique mission areas, and any Silent Sanctums he has rediscovered. Ultimately, he must travel to the Heart of the Dark and face the hordes of Taurox in a final, desperate battle. New Lizardmen units Skink Oracle Hero: Mounted atop a mighty Troglodon, the Skink Oracle wades into battle wielding a hybrid mix of the lores of Beasts, Life, Fire and Heavens. Chameleon Stalkers: These aggressive and stealthy shock infantry are adept at moving unseen around the battlefield before striking viciously from the shadows. Coatl: A highly intelligent flying monster, the Coatl can cast destructive bombardment and vortex spells, and grants stalk to any friendly units below it. Feral Troglodon: Hailing from the caves of Lustria, the Troglodon has a powerful venom-spit ranged attack which causes a range of damage types and is effective against other large creatures. New Regiments of Renown The Pale Death: A Feral Troglodon of great renown which grants itself and nearby friendlies melee buffs whenever it uses its fearsome Primeval Roar ability. Geltblöm’s Terror: This Feral Carnosaur of legend will never rampage, and has the vanguard and strider abilities, making it the ultimate first-strike monster hunter.

Following an influx of demons being let loose by an unknown event, the Highmark is in upheaval. Trolls pour down the mountains, driven from their ancestral homes, and lay waste to the cities and settlements of the Highmark and the Dwarven lands. Demon lords have set up their domains in plain sight, imposing their cruel reign and extracting the very essence of the land for their nefarious purposes. Will these new powers be an ally or an enemy to you? Where some see only danger, the clever mage spots an opportunity. Find a way to tame the troll hordes and bring them under your command, ally yourself with demons and profit from their vast powers – if you are willing to pay the price. Alternatively push back against the emerging threat and gain the respect of not only the people of the realm, but also your fellow mages. Whatever you choose, the path will be fraught with danger. Only the most cunning, the most powerful, and the most able will survive.

We fought with Horus at Terra and with Abaddon at Cadia. A handful of ancients even remember the pacification of Luna, fighting alongside the False Emperor as we crushed the gene-cultists. Yes, we have fought a long, long war. Yet, these ten thousand years, our Warband has been undivided in its faith, even though the Imperium still stands. When Cadia fell, we were there. We made our prayers to the Dark Gods for guidance and entered the Warp behind Abaddon’s fleet, and there we stayed, stuck like insects in some dead gods’ amber. We wandered dark corners, lost to the warp’s delights, until our craft found an entryway to… this dead planet. This pathetic world that stinks of the Corpse God’s Empire and more. Why have we been brought here? Something is here, something the Dark Gods need us to claim. We will find it and make it our own. Warhammer 40,000: Gladius is back with a new playable faction, the Chaos Space Marines . Fueled by their hatred for the Imperium, they will stop at nothing before they exact their revenge. Fielding hellish machines, wielding Warp powers and possessing the experience of a thousand wars, these ancient warriors are ready to conquer Gladius Prime, killing and enslaving all who oppose them. In the name of the Warmaster, and their Dark Gods. BOONS OF CHAOS Champions who prove themselves in battle might find boons bestowed upon them by the Dark Gods, and even rise to the rank of Daemon Prince. But beware, for the Gods are fickle, and those who they do not consider worthy will be transformed into Chaos Spawns instead. VETERANS OF THE LONG WAR Chaos Space Marines have fought a 10,000 years long war on the Imperium and its Corpse-Emperor. All servants of the Imperium are their arch-enemy: as thus all Chaos Space Marines units have experience in fighting against Space Marine units and gain increased morale and melee accuracy. UNHOLY RITES Chaos cities are designed to glorify the Dark Gods and torture their inhabitants in the Gods’ name. Population is a resource that Chaos Space Marines can use for unholy rites, granting significant temporary boosts depending on the God which is being worshipped.

A player can take the role of flyers, swimmers, herbivores, carnivores, and semi-aquatic creatures that fulfill different niches in the ecosystem. No matter what the player chooses to be, the objective of the game is to survive and grow up on the islands of Bermuda by using their particular creature's abilities. Predation from other players as well as intense environmental events are the antagonistic forces in the game the player must survive against. There are currently three game modes in Beasts of Bermuda. In Free Roam game mode the player selects a creature of choice and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species.  They must survive and gradually grow larger over time.  As growth accumulates, they also earn talents, which can be spent to enhance different aspects of your creature's capabilities. In this mode growth is slower but resource management is easier. In Life Cycle game mode the player selects a creature and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species. You must survive and grow larger in a fast paced growth setting. As growth accumulates, you will earn talents to enhance different aspects of your creature's capabilities. After 1.32 growth you can choose to enter a stage called Gauntlet, where the difficulty of the game increases with growth in the form of food, water, and ailment management. In this mode growth is faster but resource management is harder. Compete on a monthly leaderboard to earn the top growth ranking for your species! In Combat game mode players are pitted against one another with mechanics that are designed to reward conflict. Servers can use Deathmatch Maps which are smaller with close together spawn locations. The player spawns in as an adult creature of their choice and can accrue more talent points by killing other players and stealing their points. The game mode is endless and uses points and kill/death ratios to show who reigns supreme on the server.", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "Sastrei Studios, LLC", "publisher": "Sastrei Studios, LLC", "game_tag": "Dinosaurs", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 20 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " AMD X8 FX-8350 @ 4GHz / AMD Ryzen 3 1200 @ 3.1GHz / Intel Core i5-3470 @ 3.2GHz"},

Map Editor With RPG Maker's map editor, you can create maps with ease. Pick the tiles you want to use, and “paint” them on to your maps. With powerful enhancements from the previous RPG Maker’s map editor, and a large collection of new tiles, you can build countless towns and dungeons for your players to explore!. ●Tile size can be selected from \"16x16\", \"24x24\", \"32x32\", and \"48x48\". The new tile resolution options facilitate the use of RPG Maker VX and VXAce tile sets (32x32) and custom assets. ● The Layer Function Returns! An incredibly missed feature from RPG Maker XP returns with MZ! Map layer control has returned. You can now select which of the four map layers you are drawing onto, or leave it on Automatic to keep the behavior from MV. This gives you more control to make your maps look the way you want to, as well as speeding up the map creation process: No more having to redo an entire tile because you messed up one layer or want to change the base layer! ●Shadow pen rectangle mode for wide-area manipulation Holding down the Shift key when selecting a shadow pen allows you to switch to rectangle mode, which manipulates a wide area. ● Map Trees can be Rearranged You can now rearrange the Maps in the editor Map Tree even on the same tree level, making it easier than ever to organize your project for maximum efficiency. Character Generator Not only can you use the included characters or import your own made completely from scratch, you can also create your own original characters using component pieces using the built in Character Generator! Combine hairs, eyes, clothes, accessories, and more. Recolor them to match your vision. ● Adjust Component Positioning You can now use the offset feature in the Character Generator to adjust the placement of generator pieces, giving you greater control over the look of your heroes, villains, and NPCs! ● Add New Color Palettes You can now go beyond the existing color palettes: add your own palettes for recoloring hair, clothes, and more! A Trove of Assets Included From face graphics, character sprites, to map chips, character generator components, music, and sound effects, and more, RPG Maker MZ boasts the largest collection of assets out of the box than any RPG Maker in the series history! ● Graphics Animations: 120 Battle Background 1: 51 Battle Background 2: 50 Character Sprites Sheets: 44 Character SV Battlers: 40 Face Graphic Sheets: 15 Character Busts: 120 Character Full Art: 120 Enemy Battlers: 105 Enemy SV Battlers: 105 Tileset Sheets: 31 Parallaxes: 21 Title Screens: 20 ● Sound BGM：48 BGS：29 ME：27 SE：345 ●Sample map data（dlc\\RemakeMapResourcePackFolder） Sample map data of RPG Maker VXAce 117 Sample map data of RPG Maker MV 104 *See readme in the same folder for usage instructions Database The database is where the heart of your RPG Maker game resides. Here you store the information defining your characters, their skills, equipment, classes, but also their foes! Also in the database will be where you define many things about your game, like the names of stats, what conditions your characters can be afflicted with, battle animations, and more. ●Maximum number of major database entries can be changed to 9999 The maximum number of Actors,Classes, States, Skills, Items, Weapons, Armors, Enemies, Troops, and Common Events can now be set to 9999. This allows you to realize the game you want to create, such as a game with a wide variety of items. ●Copy and paste tileset settings Passage, Passage (4 dir), Ladder, Bush, Counter, Damage Floor, and Terrain Tag setting can now be copied and pasted to other tileset pages. This makes it easier to set up alternate tilesets. ● New Battle System Added! With RPG Maker MZ, in addition to the front and side-view options that existed in previous RPG Makers, we've added a brand new option! The Time Progress Battle System will unchain your game from traditional turns, allowing every character to act at their own speed based on their stats and conditions. Events The Event system covers all the many NPCs, treasure chests, puzzles and everything else your players will interact with in your game. Using a simple system of menus, you can create a complex series of events that will drive your game to its conclusion. All with no programming knowledge required! ● We have added an \"Quick Setting\" feature that allows you to specify coordinates from the preview screen in the picture (image) settings. This makes setting up images simple and intuitive. ● We have added a \"Quick Access\" that allows you to instantly access your favorite maps. This enables you to quickly find maps you frequently use. ● Switch to event mode to display the event list Selecting an event on the list will select the corresponding event on the map. You can also open the event editor directly from the list. ● More Powerful and Extensive Event Commands! Through the addition of elements including control characters for text displays, picture movement settings and status determination for buttons used during conditional branching, we've augmented and expanded event commands. ●Toggle Skip\" to disable a specified range of event command With the execution selected, [Skip] is created by using the shortcut key Ctrl+/ or the context menu [Toggle Skip] operation. This is useful when searching for the cause of a bug or testing the direction, since the event commands contained in [Skip] to [End] are not executed. ● Preview Added for Movement Route Settings! When setting up events, now you can check movement routes using a preview. Animation ●Particle animation with enhanced 3D expression With RPG Maker MZ, our Animations function has been completely revamped.

Plugins Sometimes, you want to go beyond what is easy to do with eventing alone. That is when Plugins come in! Plugins are bits of code that can change almost anything in your RPG Maker game. Learn to code enough to make some yourself, or find ones made by others to bolster your game. Adding an existing plugin can be as easy as plugging it in! ● Revamped Plug-in Commands It's now possible to select a plug-in name and command name from a pull-down menu rather than having to enter it from text. Additionally, you can easily pass parameters to the Plugin Command requires with a simple menu system. ● Plugin Management Made Even Easier Turn Plugins On/Off from the base Plugin Manager Screen, Easily find the plugin creator's website with the new URL field in the Edit Screen, and be sure that your plugins have all the requirements and are in the correct order with the new error messages.

Since this Event nobody has managed to get near the central regions of the galaxy. All you know is that the Event also spawned multiple untraversable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy and that a strange race of aliens, the Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to cross over the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them. There are also rumors about a strange new metal called ‘Avorion’ which has appeared in the center of the galaxy around the same time as the Xsotan have arrived. Apparently, the aliens use this material to build their ships. Start out as a nobody at the edge and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they're hit in space fights. Equip your ship with chainguns, lasers and other weaponry to take on your enemies and enjoy the sight of completely destructible ships breaking at the exact points where you hit them. Defend your allies from pirates, hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions. Once you’re victorious, collect loot from defeated foes which you can use to upgrade your ship: new turrets with special abilities like autofire or repair beams, or system upgrades that allow you to install even more weapons. Build hangars and command squads of fighters in your battles or destroy enemy freighters to steal their cargo. Fly through beautiful nebulas and dense asteroid fields in search of hidden treasures and meet the many factions that populate and control their portion of the galaxy. Each faction has its own characteristics, such as peaceful, intelligent or aggressive, and its ships and stations have a distinct look. Explore the galaxy at your own pace to find valuable goods in old ship wrecks, undiscovered asteroid fields rich in resources, gigantic asteroids which you can claim for yourself, or clues about what happened during the Event a few centuries back. There are no limits to the size or complexity of your ship besides your resources. But there is also a creative mode where you can just build to your heart’s content. You're not bound to the standard voxel style and while building an awesome ship in Avorion you won't get lost in lots and lots of micro-management. You can focus on building a great-looking ship, without having to worry about making it work. But always keep an eye on your ship’s maneuverability and energy requirements. Adjust your ship perfectly to its operational purpose: everything from light and agile explorers to heavily armored battleships with strong shields. And why build only one ship? Hire captains to fly your ships for you, manage your crews, weapons, hangars and fighters and build your own fleet of spaceships! Extend your ship with a cargo bay, find profitable deals and haul over a hundred trading goods across the galaxy to make a profit and buy your way up the food chain. Constructing a fleet of specialized transport ships with lots of cargo space will help you build up a trading corporation. Extend your influence in the galaxy by founding asteroid mines and factories that attract NPC traders who will buy and sell their goods at your establishments. Install trading systems that detect trading routes and supply and demand over multiple sectors and become the richest commander in the galaxy! Or maybe you're sick of being the good guy? Just raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods, or become a headhunter. You don't have to face all of these challenges alone! Avorion features co-op multiplayer, so team up with your friends to build stations together and destroy pirates and enemy factions! Everybody needs a copilot, and you can fly ships together, with one of you doing the steering and the other one taking care of firing weapons. Work with each other to extend your influence in the galaxy and build your own empire. Or, you know, blow your friends apart. It's a sandbox, you can do whatever you want! In Avorion you choose your personal playstyle. Haul cargo, find profitable trading routes and found factories. Or maybe you're sick of being the good guy? Build your own battleship, equip it with powerful weaponry and blow away your enemies. Be the aggressor that starts wars with entire factions, raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods and scavenge old wreckages.

{"name": "Total War: WARHAMMER II - The Prophet & The Warlock", "release_date": "17 Apr, 2019", "final_price_number_original": 226000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 226000.0, "description": "About This Content The Prophet & The Warlock is the latest Lords Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER II. Introducing two rival Legendary Lords from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, each with their own objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle, for use in both the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns, and custom/multiplayer battles. Two powerful new Legendary Lords with new quest-chains, legendary items and skills trees Play as Clan Skryre (Skaven) or the Cult of Sotek (Lizardmen) with unique new campaign mechanics Two new additional Lord types Nine new battlefield units and variants including the bullet-spewing Ratling Gun Weapon Teams and the fearsome Ripperdactyls Unleash ultimate devastation with the Clan Skryre Doomrocket, or summon an aspect of the very serpent god himself into battle with the Invocation of Sotek! New Regiments of Renown to unlock, recruit and field Background The great serpent-god Sotek may sleep, but Tehenauin – his most devoted prophet – does not. The time has come for the foul Skaven to pay the butcher’s bill for their plague-spreading acts, and pay they will – with their very lives! Tehenauin marshals his fellow Red-Crested Skinks: there will be a sacrifice. A vast, crimson sacrifice. Only when the temple-city altars are drenched with Skaven blood will the serpent god become manifest and enact his divine wrath… But the Skaven do not sit idly by while Tehenauin plans his crusade. Scenting great Warpstone deposits in the jungles of Lustria, the arch Warlock-Engineer Ikit Claw has claimed The Star Tower in the name of Clan Skryre: a staging-post from which to delve deep into the continental interior. With the Forbidden Workshop at his disposal, Ikit Claw will bend the raw stuff of chaos to his twisted designs, forging ever-more ingenious and cataclysmic weapons… and placing the Warlock-Engineer on a collision course with the Prophet of Sotek! New Legendary Lords and Factions Ikit Claw, the Warlock Engineer (Skaven, Clan Skryre) Ikit Claw – like all of Skavenkind – is naturally suspicious, untrusting, untrustworthy and treacherous. His aptitude for science and invention is unrivalled, but as well as being the greatest Skaven Warlock Engineer of all time, Ikit Claw has also developed an awesome command of the Winds of Magic. His exceptional scientific knowledge and magical powers have made him indispensable to the Council of Thirteen. In his quest for destruction, Ikit seeks to realise his grandest design – the mighty Doomsphere – and he will stop at nothing to unleash it upon the world… Clan Skryre brings several unique faction features and mechanics to Total War: WARHAMMER II: Clan Skryre Forbidden Workshop With access to the infamous Forbidden Workshop, Clan Skryre players can spend resources to upgrade various units such as Doomwheels, Doom-flayers and Weapons Teams with powerful new stat-boosts and attributes. As the player upgrades in each category, they will unlock further ancillaries and, eventually, new regiments of renown unique to the Forbidden workshop. Workshop progress requires food and Warp Fuel, a new resource gathered after battles. New research tiers in the Workshop may be unlocked by completing unique missions. But the deadliest invention by far that the Workshop offers is the Warpstorm Doomrocket. Warpstorm Doomrockets Doomrockets are outlandishly powerful weapons, deployed in battle as an Army Ability. They are crafted in the Forbidden Workshop, and can be stockpiled for use, though only one Doomrocket from the stockpile may be launched per battle. Perhaps the most powerful weapon wielded by any of the Races of WARHAMMER II, a single Doomrocket is capable of wiping out multiple units in a single strike, sending dust and debris skywards in an incinerating mushroom-cloud! Doomsphere While the Under-Empire is a feature newly-available to Skaven factions (see the Doomsayer Update Notes for more details), only Clan Skryre can build the Doomsphere within the Under-Cities they establish. This immense Warpstone bomb is powerful enough to completely destroy any settlement it is constructed below. Unique Lord – Warlock Master The Warlock Master is a caster Lord who uses the Lore of Ruin in battle. Warlock Masters have unique skills which grant further bonuses to Doom Flayers, Doomwheels and Weapons Teams. They may be upgraded to ride a Doom Flayer or Doomwheel in battle. Unique Units Ratling Gun Weapons Team: Specialist anti-infantry gun teams bearing the rotating, rapid-fire Ratling Gun. Ratling Guns are heavy damage-dealers which also Supress their targets, slowing their movement. Warplock Jezzails: Long-range, armour-piercing sniper infantry. These sharpshooters have the highest-quality shields, and their projectiles confer the Shieldbreaker contact effect. Doom-Flayers: Smaller than the Doomwheel (and twice as messy!), Doom-Flayers are designed to punch through enemy lines and deal powerful armour-piercing damage. Regiments of Renown These unique, elite variants are unlocked for recruitment as Ikit Claw and his Lords level up. Ikit's Zzzzap-Zzzzap! (Warp Lightning Cannon): These arcane artillery pieces stun their enemies with the Zzzzap! Contact effect, increasing the target’s ability cooldown times. Clan Vulkn Tailslashers (Clanrats - Shields): Fiery vermin with high weapon-strength who deal flaming attacks, while being immune to the effects of flame-weapons themselves. Blightscab's Plaguepack (Plague Monk Censer Bearers): Heed the word! Blightscab’s Plaguepack have the Demegoguery ability, granting the Immune to Psychology attribute to nearby friendly units. Teeth-Breakers (Ratling Gun Weapons Team): These sneaky shooters carry Concealment Bombs, granting them Stalk and Unspottable at a moment’s notice. Council Guard (Stormvermin - Halberds): Drilled in the protection of their masters, the Council Guard are unbreakable and have the Guardian ability. Natty Buboe's Sharpshooters (Warplock Jezzails): The ultimate sniper crew, Natty Buboe’s Sharpshooters have both the Stalk and the Snipe abilities. Dwarf-Thing Menace (Doom-flayers): Perfect for scything through tough Dawi armour, the Dwarf-Thing Menace has the Sunder Armour contact effect and causes fear. Wheelz of Dooom (Doomwheel): Fires extra-powerful missiles which confer the Discourage contact effect on their target. Five additional Regiments of Renown will become available upon completion of key projects in the Forbidden Workshop. These units are only available in campaign, not in custom and multiplayer battles: Warpfire’s Wheel (Doomwheel): An augmented Doomwheel with improved melee stats and the Regeneration attribute. Blackhole Flayers (Doom-Flayers): These enhanced Doom-Flayers have improved melee stats and cause Fear. The Doombringers (Warpfire Thrower Weapons Team): With increased melee stats and the Unbreakable attribute, this Warpfire Thrower Weapons Team can tar-pit other units in melee if attacked. Eye-Takers (Warplock Jezzails): Headshot! The Eye-Takers’ enhanced Jezzails deal increased damage and Blind their targets, reducing their accuracy, melee attack and melee defence. Death Dealers (Ratling Gun Weapons Team): The Ratling Gun perfected! These weapons teams fire their hails of bullets at longer range, dealing greater damage and with reduced reload times. Tehenhauin, Prophet of Sotek (Lizardmen, Cult of Sotek) Tehenhauin, a Red Crested Skink, emerged as the charismatic Prophet of Sotek after a devastating plague was spread across Lustria by Clan Pestilens. As he led a migration out of the defiled city of Chaqua where the disease began, he prophesised the coming of the Serpent-God and rallied the surviving population of Lizardmen to join his counterattack. As Sotek’s cult grew, so too did the Prophet’s following, and for many years Tehenhauin led his apostles to many victories, slaughtering countless captives as sacrificial offerings in the hope that their spilt blood would bring forth the Serpent-God himself. The Cult of Sotek faction brings two new campaign mechanics to Total War: WARHAMMER II: Prophecy of Sotek Tehenauin believes that with sufficient sacrifices, the serpent-god may yet return, bringing salvation to the Lizardmen and the extermination of the Skaven. Tehenauin will be issued with a series of unique missions, the completion of which grants access to new forms of sacrifice. When performed, these reward Tehenauin with unique banners, followers, powerful temporary effects, Regiments of Renown and more. Sacrifices to Sotek As Tehenauin and his forces win battles against non-Lizardmen armies, they may choose to mark any post-battle captives as Sacrificial Offerings. As the offerings build, they may be spent on performing the sacrifices accessed by the Prophecy of Sotek missions. The ultimate sacrifice: Invocation of Sotek The highest level of sacrifice grants Tehenauin the ability to evoke Sotek himself, manifesting an aspect of the serpent-god in battle to deal devastating damage to his foes. Unique Lord: Red-Crested Skink Chief Red-Crested Skink Chiefs are powerful melee-focussed Lords capable of leading armies, with their own unique skills tree. They may be upgraded to ride a Horned One, a Ripperdactyl, and later, a fearsome Ancient Stegadon. Unique units Tehenauin’s armies may recruit and field all-new battlefield units: Red Crested Skinks: Armed with great weapons, Red Crested Skinks deal armour-piercing damage. Moving at tremendous pace, they are well-equipped to swiftly outflank the enemy and strike from the side or rear. Salamander Hunting Pack: Powerful ranged-attack monsters that hurl fireballs, deal flaming attacks in melee and cause fear. Their high speed enables them to reposition swiftly in the field. Ancient Salamander: A vast and venerable Salamander that hurls huge fireballs, dealing high damage and making the target more vulnerable to further flame attacks. The Ancient Salamander also deals flaming attacks in melee and causes terror. Ripperdactyl Riders: Flying anti-infantry cavalry ridden by Skinks, dealing powerful armour-piercing damage in melee. Ancient Stegadon (Engine of the Gods): A variant of the mighty Stegadon mounted with the Engine of the Gods, which can use the Burning Alignment beam-attack, and the Portent of Warding to protect nearby friendly units. Bastiladon (Ark of Sotek): A Bastiladon mounted with the Ark of Sotek, able to summon a writhing vortex of poison-dealing serpents around itself in combat. Regiments of renown Tehenauin’s armies may field all-new Regiments of Renown. These are unlocked for recruitment as the appropriate sacrifices are made to Sotek. The Thunderous One (Ancient Stegadon): Armed with the Judgement of Xacmac ability, The Thunderous One calls down bolts of lightning to strike enemies engaging it in melee. Star Chamber Guardians (Temple Guard): These venerable warriors have Expert Charge Defence, Magic Attacks, and the Guardian attributes. Colossadon Hunters (Ripperdactyl Riders): Expert monster-fighters, the Collossadon Hunters have the Bonus VS Large ability.

{"name": "Total War: WARHAMMER - Realm of The Wood Elves", "release_date": "8 Dec, 2016", "final_price_number_original": 431500.0, "final_price_number_discount": 431500.0, "description": "About This Content New Wood Elves Race in the Grand Campaign New additional Race-specific currency: Amber Wonder-based Campaign victory condition Wood Elves may conquer any region on the map Two New Playable Legendary Lords: Orion and Durthu Two new Lord types with deep-specialisation skill trees Three new Hero types with deep-specialisation skill trees Comprehensive Wood Elves army roster Adds an additional campaign map to the game with the unique ‘Season of Revelations’ Wood Elves story Campaign New Unique Monsters, Heroes, Magic and Game Features To outsiders, the forest realm of Athel Loren is a brooding and malicious place. The creak and groan of living wood echoes from its dim interior, the canopy seems to absorb all light, and half-seen spirits dart between the twilit bowers. To enter is to place your fate in their hands. Within dwell the Asrai, the Wood Elves. Though they hail originally from Ulthuan to the west as all Elves do, they spurn the sanctimonious arrogance of the Asur, the High Elves, and the murderous decadence of the Druchii or Dark Elves. The Asrai consider themselves to be the only true Elves left in the world, as they embrace all aspects of their nature – both light and dark – and for thousands of years, they have lived in harmony with the sentient forest. The Asrai share the wilds of Athel Loren with its spirits and protectors: the Dryads, Branchwraiths and the ancient guardian Treemen. They adopt its steeds, hawks and Great Eagles for their warhosts, and even rare Forest Dragons may deign to join them when the need is dire. Peerless archers and riders, the Wood Elves pay fealty to the demigod Orion, who dies in flame each midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life in spring beneath The Oak of Ages. Wild, lithe, and utterly ruthless in defence of their land, only a fool would goad the Wood Elves and their spirited allies to conflict. For those who witness the awesome spectacle of an Asrai host marching out of the woodlands on a Wild Hunt, it is likely the last thing they will ever see. Campaign playstyle The Wood Elves campaign offers a uniquely different campaign experience to the other playable races of Total War: WARHAMMER. Their major infrastructure is housed in the Wood Elf settlements of Athel Loren, though they are capable of expanding outwards, capturing settlements and building limited outposts, known as Asrai Lookouts, in their stead. The heart of the campaign is The Great Oak, a unique 5-tier building related to the new Wonder victory condition. In battle, the Wood Elves are swift and deadly, fielding many ‘glass cannon’ style units. While less physically robust than most other races, and with smaller unit sizes, they make up for this with excellent melee and ranged capabilities. They field some of the best archers in the game, many of whom can move and fire, and may later be upgraded with a range of specialised ammunition. They are often accompanied in battle by the woodland kin of Athel Loren, such as Dryads, Eagles and Treemen. Their spellcasters wield the Lores of Life, Beasts and Shadows. New Story Campaign: The Season of Revelation Set across a beautiful and highly-detailed campaign map of Athel Loren and the surrounding Duchies of Breton, The Season of Revelation is playable as either Durthu or Orion, the Wood Elves’ two Legendary Lords. This campaign tasks the player with uniting Athel Loren in the face of Bretonnian incursions and, later, from a series of fearsome, climactic attacks by the Beastman warlord Morghur, and his corrupted bray-herds. The Oak of Ages The vast, ancient bowers of The Oak of Ages mark the spiritual heart of Athel Loren and the source of its sacred power. In the Grand Campaign, The Oak of Ages is a unique 5-tier Wonder building sited in Athel Loren which the player must grow over the course of the campaign. As the Wood Elf player advances it to each new tier, they will receive increasing bonuses to their campaign. Growing The Oak to tier 5 initiates The Battle of The Great Oak, a climactic multi-stage assault on Athel Loren’s spiritual centre by the combined and massed hordes of the Beastmen and Chaos Warriors. Victory (or survival!) marks the completion of the Wood Elves’ key campaign objective. New additional currency: Amber Alongside Gold, the Wood Elves require Amber to recruit certain elite units, to unlock certain technologies, and to expand the Oak of Ages. This is a finite resource in the world however, and can only be gained by capturing settlements and setting up Asrai Lookouts. As Amber is limited, this presents the player with a constant choice over whether it should be spent on faction development, military might or achieving their key victory condition. Wood Elf Settlements and Outposts The Wood Elves are capable of capturing any province in The Old World, regardless of its race origin. However, these settlement locations can only ever house Asrai Lookouts with very limited building options, turning them into army replenishment stops, recruitment stations (with access to the global recruitment pool but at local recruitment pricing), or as centres to exploit any regional trade resources. Major building chains will need to be built in the regions of Athel Loren itself, the only true home of the Wood Elves. Settlements in Athel Loren have 10 building slots, providing space to explore the Wood Elves’ extensive building trees. Wood Elves infrastructure The Wood Elves have unique tech trees and buildings, and as a highly developed and somewhat aristocratic race, the Wood Elf Council presides over matters social and military. This Council has a number of Offices to which characters may be appointed, and is subtly connected to the Wood Elves’ infrastructure. Certain buildings unlock Offices for example: if the Wild Heath building is unlocked in the tech tree, it can be built in a settlement, thereby unlocking the Herald Of The Hunt office. If one of the player’s Lords is appointed to this role, he will periodically call a Wild Hunt. This gives the Herald and his army a series of very significant bonuses for the turns in which the Wild Hunt event is active, heightening their marshal prowess and encouraging aggressive actions. Players are advised to explore these interconnections in order to get the most out of their Wood Elf campaigns. The two Wood Elves legendary Lords, Orion and Durthu, both have Offices to which only they can be appointed, providing them with further campaign bonuses. New Legendary Lords A Wood Elves Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the demigod Orion, The King in The Woods, or the ancient Treeman, Durthu. Each begins play in a different starting position, controlling a different Athel Loren faction, and bring their own suite of campaign bonuses. Orion The King in The Woods Orion is the immortal demigod-king of Athel Loren and the Wood Elves. When his realm is threatened, he is the first to take up arms and fight in its defence. Every Elf feels the lure of their king’s wild summons, and many are overcome by their primal urges, abandoning civilised concerns and for the thrill of the hunt, and the heady tang of blood upon the wind. Orion is a powerful melee warrior who also can deal sizeable ranged damage with his long-range spear attacks. He also has two unique area-effect abilities: Hounds of Orion, a magical vortex, and Hawk’s Talon, a magical bombardment. These attacks are bound to Orion and do not consume Winds of Magic. Orion has two combat skill trees, two battle skill trees, and a campaign skill tree. This great range of skills, many of which are unique, allows him to specialise as he levels up. In particular, he can bring numerous improvements to the many bow units in the Wood Elves roster. When recruiting forces, Orion must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire woodland spirit units. Durthu Most ancient of the might Treemen of Athel Loren, Durthu was once a benevolent creature who found joy in the weave of forest life. It was he who first bound the spirits of the woodlands to the fate of the Asrai. And for a time, things existed in balance and harmony. After many bloody incursions into Athel Loren however, with countless tress felled by outsiders for fuel, or merely out of spite, Durthu has become embittered. Worse still, he believes the Wood Elves themselves invited many of these calamities. Now, he does not consider them friends: merely allies in a common cause. In the grand Campaign, Durthu leads the woodland spirits of the region of Argwylon in Athel Loren.  When recruiting forces, he must pay an extra cost in Amber to hire Wood Elf units. A powerful warrior and spellcaster, Durthu also wields the Lore of Beasts, and may summon Manticores into the thick of battle using The Transformation of Kadon. New Lords Wood Elves armies may recruit two new types of Lord to command their armies: Glade lords and Treemen. Glade Lords The Highborn lords and ladies of Athel Loren have ruled the Wood Elves for millennia, and when the race goes to war, it is these nobles that direct their forces. Powerful warriors and excellent archers, they have two personal combat skill trees, each of which brings improvements to their archery and melee abilities. Likewise, their Battle trees augment their armies along two different paths – mell and ranged. They may also unlock three mount options as they level up: the Elven Steed, Great Eagle, and Forest Dragon. Ancient Treemen Ancient Treemen are colossal in stature. Revered by Elf and forest-creature alike, their strength rivals that of even the dragons of the deep glades. The true guardians of the forest, these mighty woodland spirits are Spellcaster lords who wield the Lore of Beasts. While they have no mount options (there are few creatures in the world big enough to accommodate them), they have unique skills which grant increasing protection to all Tree Kin units in their armies. Heroes Wood Elves armies may recruit three new types of Hero units to support their armies and perform Campaign Map actions. Each offers strong specialisation paths via their skill trees. Spellsingers (Mage focus) Wood Elf mages have a unique relationship with Athel Loren. Connected to the deeper intelligence of the forest, they are highly attuned beings, sharing a bond with their surroundings in much the same way the Dryads, sprites and Treemen do. Spellsingers may be recruited to wield the Lores of Life, Shadow and Beasts. Branchwraiths (Melee/Mage focus) Eldest of the Dryads, Branchwraith serve as handmaidens to the ancients of Athel Loren. Before the coming of the Elves, it was they who ruled the forest and tamed the Winds of Magic to bring sustenance to the wild woodlands. There is no love lost between Branchwraiths and the Asrai, though the uneasy peace continues, and these skilled practitioners of The Lore of Life can be found in many Wood Elf warhosts, casting spells in the thick of battle one minute, striking down foes with their powerful limbs the next. Waystalkers (Spy, Ranged focus) The most skilled marksmen of the Waywatchers, Waystalkers are obsessed with The Hunt. Taciturn, solitary individuals, they show a dedication to their path that puts them in closer touch with the forest than their Elven kin. Expert snipers, they can move – and even remain hidden – while firing, singling out targets for the kill with a ruthless precision that no other archer can match. Unit roster The Wood Elves roster contains many skilled archer units. When certain structures have been built, Glade Guard, Deepwood Scouts and Glade Riders may be recruited to fire three specialised ammunition types: Starfire shafts (Fire damage) Hagbane Tips (Poison damage) Swift Silver Shards (Magical damage) Melee Infantry Eternal Guard Eternal Guard (shields) Wardancers Wardancers (Asrai spears) Wildwood Rangers Ranged infantry Glade Guard Glade Guard (Starfire Shafts) Glade Guard (Hagbane Tips) Deepwood Scouts Deepwood Scouts (Swift Shiver Shafts) Waywatchers Melee Cavalry Wild Riders Wild Riders (shields) Ranged cavalry Glade Riders Glade Riders (Hagbane Tips) Hawk Riders (flying) Magical cavalry Sisters of The Thorn (may cast bound spells) Woodland Spirit units Dryads Treekin Treeman Monstrous Units Great Eagle (flying) Forest Dragon (flying)", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 3 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 35 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " 3.4GHz Intel Core i3-4130, 3.5GHz AMD FX6300"},

Following His edict, you have never doubted or ceased to pursue your calling—to gather knowledge and to employ it to gather more. In pursuit of that, you built the devices and machines that enabled the Imperium to conquer the galaxy 10,000 years ago and maintain it today. So Gladius Prime was your planet more than it was the Imperium’s—what Hive World was not? Its cities, its satellites, its wastes—all were built with Mars’ technology, all answered only to the Adeptus Mechanicus—that is, to you. It was little effort to hide the Adeptus Mechanicus research into the Tyranids here, in a facility deep beneath the ashen wastes. Now, however, your facility has been compromised, your Skitarii forces scattered and your subjects have escaped. You must rebuild, recover and take Gladius Prime’s secrets for your own. For you have a mission to fulfil, from the Omnissiah himself… A new faction joins the war for Gladius Prime The Adeptus Mechanicus are an empire within the Imperium, with their own agenda, their own god (‘The Omnissiah’) and their own fanatical purpose—the discovery of knowledge, of technology. Though they supply the technical and scientific expertise of the Imperium, they also possess their own elite armies of bionically-augmented soldiers. Xenos or man, stand in their way and they will annihilate you. Gameplay Mechanics Canticles of the Omnissiah: Chant Mechanicus hymns to enhance units, increasing in power with every praying warrior. Doctrina Imperatives: Override Skitarii subroutines to amplify some combat aspects while reducing others. Hive Cities: Place more buildings per tile by utilizing Adeptus Mechanicus’ capability to create layered constructions of rockcrete and adamantium. Monolithic Buildings: Increased output of buildings of the same type on a tile. Decreased output of buildings of differing types on a tile. Power Surge: Increase the output of buildings on a tile through forceful intensity. Enslaved to the Past: Increased research cost. The ability to truly innovate has long been lost, replaced with a reverence for the times when Humanity was the architect of its own destiny. Reprogram Kastelan Robot: Capture enemy Kastelan Robots with Cybernetica Datasmiths’ programming rituals. Bionics: Adeptus Mechanicus units have high damage resistances. Generally, artificial limbs are more durable than their biological counterparts. Adjacency Integration: Adeptus Mechanicus upgrades increase building output with each adjacent building.

Thereford, we would like use interactive video as tool to create one fantasy dream after another, to create dreams for players, and to make our dreams to come true for ourselves. Written at the end At the beginning, we said we were going to make a interactive video, and then there were a lot of topics. As for why we finally chose love, it may be because the pictures posted in the intro slides are eye-catching . We, nerds in the team, had suddenly become impatient. Then we immediately decided, \"I want to fall in love , I want to date girls!\" After we’ve decided the topic, we started to collect \"secrets\" from our friends. The nerdy guy, named B, his first love was on the night of the graduation party of high school. He saw the female classmate who shared a table with him, drinking and singing with others, and only then did he realize that this girl was so  interesting and adorable. But after that night, he never saw her again ; L (he paints a lot and do it for a living, but he does not allow us to call him a painter) once fell for a girl who is five years older than him. The girl repeated the final year of high school 4 times, but still didn’t get herself enrolled in the professional Fine Arts school, and finally let go of the obsession and became a substitute teacher in an art institution. That is the reason why L studied Fine Arts; A College student ,C, fell in love with his fellow student, but this girl had a childhood sweetheart; W,born with a silver spoon, is a little luckier than C, but not much. He did have a childhood sweetheart, but when they grew up, this girl got married with another guy; G,a wage slave, once met a single mother in a blind date event. He have made up his mind to go further with this lady. Unexpectedly, she has already met another one. … All these emotional and heart-breaking experiences are full of regrets and make people feel sad. We originally wanted to use this as the keynote to write a love story full of regrets but unforgettable, but our friends said that life is already not satisfactory, why not sprinkle some sweetness in the game? So here we goes, we have \"Damn! I am surrounded by beauties\" now. It's a satisfying love story. Hope my friends will be healed by this story. If you happen to have such a girl in your memory, it would be an honer to our the production team. By the way, there is actually another friend of us, X, my college roommate. He is still studying in university, doing experiments and writing papers day and night, and he is relationship virgin.

Between the twisted trunks, the Beastlords grow restless with an all-consuming battle-thirst. They gather to them great Warherds of barbarous, bestial fiends, forged in the Time of Chaos; dark amalgams of human intelligence, animal cunning and raw, reckless ferocity. As The Beastmen emerge from their woodland lairs, ten thousand hooves stamp in agitated union, and a foetid musk arises from the sea of matted fur. The bray of the battle-horns pierces the gloom, and beyond: from Bordeleaux to Ostermark, the Call Of The Beastmen will be heard across The Old World! The Call of The Beastmen Campaign Pack introduces the Beastmen as a playable race to Total War: WARHAMMER. A feral, Chaos-tainted horde race, they move like a plague across The Old World, fielding half-human aberrations and colossal beasts in battle, many of which feature unique abilities. The Beastmen are playable in the Grand Campaign, custom and multiplayer battles, and in their very own Story Campaign, An Eye For An Eye. An Eye For An Eye An Eye For An Eye is a compact Story Campaign that pits the Beastmen in a berserk guerrilla war against mankind. The theatre of conflict is a bespoke campaign map representing the densely forested landmass stretching from The Reikland Channel in the West to Hochland in the east. The player assumes the role of Legendary Beast-Lord Khazrak The One Eye as he lays waste to the lands of men and attempts to slay his nemesis Boris Todbringer, the Graf of Middenheim. Other Beastmen tribes lurk in the wild woodlands however, and a great show of arms will be required to secure their loyalty… Campaign playstyle Horde gameplay The Beastmen offer a uniquely aggressive horde-style campaign game, carrying their infrastructure as they travel and never settling in the conventional fashion. Unlike Chaos Warrior hordes however, all Beastmen units bear the Resilience passive ability. This makes them immune to the attrition caused by infighting when two or more hordes stand in close proximity, and promotes a more collaborative approach between hordes. Chaos Corruption The Beastmen also spread Chaos Corruption wherever they go, destabilising provinces and causing attrition to enemy forces. With unique Heroes, building chains, tech trees, recruitment options, Lord and Hero skill-trees, and an exclusive Lore of Magic (The Lore of The Wild), they offer a new and feral way to play Total War: WARHAMMER. Bestial Rage Each army led by a Beastmen Lord has a Bestial Rage meter. As the army raids or engages in battle, this meter rises until a new Brayherd is summoned – an AI controlled Beastmen horde that can be directed by the player to specific targets, or support the parent army as it moves. If any army’s Bestial Rage falls too low, it may begin infighting, leading to loss of troops and, in the worst instances, mutiny. Unique army stances The Beastmen playstyle is also characterised through their unique army stances. Beastmen Ambush is their standard mode of campaign map movement and enables the army to ambush enemy forces on the move. The Hidden Encampment stance lets the army melt into the shadows and focus on their infrastructure and recruitment, invisible to all but the keenest-eyed enemy Lords. Beast-Paths enables the army to ignore impassable terrain by following the secret paths known only to their kind. If an army is attacked in this stance, the ensuing battle will take place in one of the atmospheric new Beast Path battle-maps. Like other races, The Beastmen can also enter the Raiding stance to harvest income, increase Bestial Rage and sow public disorder in enemy territory. Unique post-battle options When a Beastmen army conquers an enemy settlement, the player gets two new post-battle options. Raze and Loot harvests income from the settlement before destroying it, while Raze and Defile razes the settlement and erects a blasphemous monument in its place. This generates major Chaos Corruption in the province and confers a large Population Growth bonus upon the horde. The Dark Moon rises! The Beastmen share a dark bond with Morrslieb, the Chaos Moon. As it waxes in the night sky, they are given to feats of drunken bacchanalia and ghastly sacrifice beneath its sickly gaze. When a periodic Full Moon event occurs in the Beastmen campaign game, the player must direct his Warherds in which twisted act to perform. There is often a price to be paid for such dark celebrations, but Morrslieb always rewards the faithful! Legendary Lords A Beastmen Grand Campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: the fearsome Beastlord Khazrak The One Eye, or the blasphemous Bray-Shaman, Malagor The Dark Omen. Each has their own skill trees, abilities, quest-chains, legendary items, and Grand Campaign start positions. Khazrak begins the Grand Campaign in the Tobaro Region of Estalia, while Malagor begins play in The Marshes of Madness, deep in the Badlands. Khazrak The One Eye The bestial intelligence that seethes behind Khazrak’s one good eye makes him the paragon of Beastlords. Gifted with the patience and strategic shrewdness of the most accomplished generals, Khazrak wages the perfect guerrilla war, striking hard and fast where the enemy is weakest, then melting into the shadows to plan the next blow. The only Lord of men ever to best him is Boris Todbringer of Middenheim, who deprived him of an eye with a slash of his Runefang blade. Now Khazrak is on the offensive once more. Warherd in tow, he stalks his nemesis through the twisted bowers of Drakland, intending to repay the courtesy in full. An eye for an eye! As well as a Beastlord, Khazrak The One Eye is a powerful melee warrior with two quest-chains, rewarding him with the unique items Scourge and The Dark Mail. Scourge is a vicious, barbed whip, wrapped in the bitter curses of countless generations of Bray-Shamans. In battle, Scourge improves Khazrak’s Melee Attack and Weapon Strength characteristics; on the Campaign Map, it reduces recruitment costs for Khazrak’s horde, intensifies the Chaos Corruption he generates and increases Khazrak’s post-battle loot amount. The Dark Mail is an ancient coat of magical armour that enhances Khazrak’s Armour and Magical Resistance characteristics. Khazrak has the abilities Missile Resistance (15%), Resilience, Encourage, Hide (Forest) and Primal Rage (see Unique Abilities below for details). If you choose Khazrak The One Eye as your starting Legendary Lord, your race gains +10% income from Raiding and +5 leadership when fighting humans. Malagor The Dark Omen To the Beastmen – and indeed, to the inhabitants of The Empire – Malagor is the fleshly incarnation of mankind’s demise. Unsurpassed in his grasp of The Lore of The Wild, the rites he performs are iniquitous enough to quail even the foulest of Bray-Shamans. When Malagor and his hordes descend upon a human settlement, he delights in sacrificing priests on the very altars they served. No act of blasphemy is too abhorrent, no desecration too foul, for Malagor The Dark Omen. Malagor has a single quest-chain which rewards him with a unique item, The Icons of Vilification. This filth-encrusted collection of blasphemous relics – the skulls of dead priests, branches torn from the hallowed trees of Athel Loren, and more – reduces the recruitment cost and increases the rank of lesser Bray-Shamans. In battle, The Icons emit an aura that increases the damage output of those around Malagor. Malagor has the abilities Missile Resistance (15%), Resilience, Encourage, Hide (Forest) and Primal Rage (see Unique Abilities below for details). Malagor can also unlock a unique skill at level 15: Something Wicked This Way Comes. This confers a permanent Hex spell on Malagor, causing -4 Leadership to nearby enemy units in battle and -3 Leadership to enemy armies in Malagor’s campaign map region. If you choose Malagor The Dark Omen as your starting Legendary Lord, your faction can field +1 Bray-Shaman, and all your characters gain +5% movement range. Lords Warherds are commanded by Beastlords, the braying, stomping masters of their kind. Along with Campaign, Battle and Melee skill-trees unique to The Beastmen race, Beastlords also have a number of unique skill unlocks improving their melee attack, melee defence, leadership, weapon strength and missile resistance statistics, making them exceedingly powerful warriors as well as great leaders. Beastlords may also be mounted on Razorgor Chariots from rank 15 onwards. Heroes The Beastmen can recruit and field two unique Hero types. Gorebull Gorebulls are hulking, twin-horned melee specialists – the very mightiest examples of Minotaurs. Combat prowess aside, they also boast newly-configured skill-trees offering strong specialisation options. These culminate in powerful passive and active support skills, which enhance the campaign and battle capabilities of any horde they join. Bray-Shaman Bray-Shamans are spellcaster Heroes, capable of employing The Lore of Death, The Lore of Beasts, or the bestial school of magic known only to The Beastmen, The Lore of The Wild. This Lore boasts a variety of unique Hexes, Augments and Magic Missiles, but arguably its most powerful spell is Savage Dominion, which enables the Bray-Shaman to summon a Cygor directly into the thick of battle! Battlefield units Unique Abilities Units in the Beastmen roster benefit from some unique passive abilities which confer benefits in combat. These are as follows. Resilience An ability common to all units in the Beastmen roster, Resilience prevents the attrition caused by infighting between hordes in close proximity on the Campaign map. Primal Fury Many Gor units (Ungors, Gors, Bestigors and Centigors) have the Primal Fury ability, which brings a constant active buff to their Speed, Charge Bonus and Melee Attack characteristics. Rowdy Centigors are emboldened when fighting, drinking and feasting together, although such ‘bravery’ is only temporary at best. In battle, they gain immunity to vigour-loss and a leadership bonus. If their morale begins to waver however, the Rowdy effect is lost. Bloodgreed The Minotaurs’ Bloodgreed makes them vicious combatants, and brings buffs to their Charge Bonus, Speed, Weapon Damage and Melee Attack characteristics. Soul Eater The towering bipedal Cygor feasts on the souls of wizards. Any spellcasters within range of a Cygor’s aura suffer an increased chance to miscast. Thunderous Charge The porcine, tusky bulk of the Razorgor makes for a Thunderous Charge, granting buffs to its Charge Speed and Charge Bonus characteristics. Vanguard Deployment While this ability is not unique to The Beastmen, the majority of units in the Beastmen roster have it. This means that large swathes of the army may be deployed outside the normal deployment zone and deep in the field, ready to close with the enemy and strike in very short order.

Their mission: to establish diplomatic and trade relations, to explore and reclaim the lands left to the mercy of monsters and pirates, and, most importantly, to plant a new tree city that can become a refuge for the Mka and their allies. Regardless of the success or failure of their mission, the caravans must send the memories they have gained back to the capital, using the crystospheres carried by traveling beetles. Guide a caravan of adventurers through varied landscapes. Fight hordes of pirates, wizards and monsters, and survive acid rain, storms and heat waves. Rescue refugees, seek allies to support you and stir up the past in search of the causes of Phithi. Keep hope : in this hostile desert, the caravaneers' faith in their mission is all that protects them from certain death. Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan. Make choices that will affect your future expeditions. Each character has different powers. It's up to you to explore lost ruins as an archaeologist or to track down massive creatures as a hunter. Don't underestimate the weather! It conditions the movements of caravanners and the outcome of confrontations.

Take part in key offensives of the Great War, from the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo to the Strafexpedition, and lead your team to victory among the scenic landscapes and peaks of Northern Italy. Isonzo is a realistic tactical multiplayer FPS crafted by BlackMill Games, known for their critically acclaimed authentic WW1 wargames such as Verdun and Tannenberg. Immerse yourself in faithful recreations of historical battles with intense 48-player matches, testing your tactical skills and mastery of Alpine warfare. Decide your path to victory: whether you’re leading the offensive with grenades or using mountain trails to flank enemy positions, you have options. Dive into combat or take a supporting role cutting barbed wire and crewing heavy machine guns and mortars. Thanks to a unique flare gun system, mark targets for artillery strikes or biplane flybys, before charging in to finish the job at close quarters with bayonets or trench clubs. Choose from six distinct classes and build your loadout from a selection of 50+ iconic WW1 weapons, along with historically accurate equipment and perks specific to each class. Play as a Marksman to pick off soldiers from afar, storm enemy lines with the Assault class, issue tactical orders as an Officer, and much more.

Trench periscopes and sniper shields offer even more tactical options, but beware of poisonous gas attacks and artillery barrages! Taking inspiration from the years-long struggle for control of the Alps during World War One, Isonzo brings the authenticity of the conflict to all players.

Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it. Dune: Imperium blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat… or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits. In Dune: Imperium , you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides. The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose. Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path? As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?

Harvest raw materials, hunt, fish and farm to sustain your advancing town. Produce crafted items for villagers to trade, consume, equip and fight with as you battle for your survival against the elements and outside threats (pacifist mode available for players who do not want to engage in combat). Key Features Harvest, Grow, Craft - Harvest 14 different raw materials from wood, stone and clay, to metal ores, wild herbs, and honey. Grow 17 types of food, including forage items, fish and game, plus 10 food crops, each with different characteristics. Produce 32 crafted items and materials in a multi—tiered economy. Build and Advance - Construct 50 different types of buildings as you grow your town from a fledgling settlement to a bustling city. Your town center and housing will advance through multiple building tiers as the prosperity and desirability of your town increases. Upgrade production buildings to increase efficiency and enable production of more advanced items. Most Detailed Farming System Ever - Strategically select from 10 crops with unique growing characteristics and configure crop rotations to maintain soil fertility, avoid heat and frost damage, and prevent the accumulation of diseases. Cultivate your fields over time, removing weeds and rocks, raising fertility and adjusting soil mixture to achieve maximum crop production to keep your growing population fed. Advanced Town Simulation - Villagers actively live their lives and perform their jobs in real time. Watch as villagers carry goods across town from remote work-sites to be processed into materials and crafted into items. See foods and goods delivered to homes, the trade post or stored for later use. Develop roads, transport wagons and improve storage methods to facilitate the efficient movement of goods through your town and prevent spoilage. Randomly Generated Maps - Farthest Frontier is highly replayable and no game is ever quite the same with beautiful, completely randomized terrain generation and resource distribution. Controls allow players to specify the amount of water or mountains they desire, with extreme maps leading to unique challenges. Idyllic to Brutal - Customizable difficulty options allow players to turn off features like invaders and disease, for a more tranquil experience or max out difficulty to truly test their town-builder prowess. Environmental Interaction - Develop your economy based on which resources are locally abundant and produce items for trade to acquire that which you lack. Erect fencing to keep deer away from crop fields and stop bears from raiding food storage. Manage tree cover to prevent underground water supplies from drying up. Balance the need to clear land for agriculture around vital natural resources like wild growing medicinal plants and forage items. All Them Old-Timey Diseases! - Ensure your villagers have clean water to stop outbreaks of dysentery and cholera. Collect berries and plant greens to avoid scurvy and ensure a healthy diet. Make sure villagers are properly shoed and clothed to reduce chances of contracting tetanus, rabies or frostbite. Build a healer’s house to quarantine the infected and provide herbs and medicine for treatment. Manage rodent populations by collecting waste, securely storing food and employing rat catchers to ward off the feared bubonic plague. Fend Off Would-Be Invaders - Choose to play on pacifist and avoid combat altogether or engage with varying levels of raider difficulty to raise the stakes for your town’s survival. Progress from wood palisades to stone walls, build towers and barracks, recruit and equip soldiers in the defense of your town as rising prosperity attracts the attention of raiders and foreign armies seeking plunder.

Research new technologies, build up your nuclear stockpile and use a combination of ships, planes and missiles to strike at the heart of your opponents’ cities while keeping your population safe from harm. Take command of one of the continents of the world and prepare yourself for global nuclear conflict. It is your job to ensure the complete and total destruction of your enemies, while you do all in your power to prevent enemy retaliation against your peace-loving citizens. Research and develop your nuclear arsenal. Will you focus on developing new technologies, or mass producing existing ones? It takes a true strategist to research and build a balanced force that can deal with a multitude of enemy tactics. In ICBM, you can try out different strategies every time you play. Will you overwhelm your enemy with intercontinental ballistic missiles? Use bombers to deliver massive payloads? Or maybe use submarines to deliver nukes from the least expected locations? These strategies and more can all be used to ensure victory. ICBM has 20 unit types and 12 nuclear weapon types to use, plus 44 technologies to explore. Take the time to carefully plan your next move, or just nuke your opponents as fast as you can. Increase the contamination speed for a swift and painless nuclear war, or slow it down for an endless nightmare. In ICBM, you can constantly adjust the game speed to your own pace. Use diplomacy to gain strategic advantages. Share information, technologies or even the location of your nukes with your allies to wage war against common enemies. Be aware however that these alliances do not have to last and you might find yourself fending off attacks by your former friends. Reduce micro-management by making use of the strike planner. Set up detailed plans in advance, targeting specific structures, units and cities and synchronise your ICBM launches to overwhelm the enemies defences. Play with up to seven other players in multiplayer matches. Play in free for all, fixed teams or coop games, all while improving your ELO score as you climb the leaderboard.

Drawing on a wide variety of influences and capturing the subtle intrigue of classic spy films, the game thrust the player into a mysterious world of covert operations, counterintelligence, conspiracy and paranoia. As leader of a secret organization known only as The Cabal, you are charged with preventing a global conspiracy that seeks to pit leader against leader, and nation against nation. By carrying out secret missions, investigating classified files, and interrogating enemy agents, a sinister plot is uncovered. With the clock ticking, it must be thwarted in order to save the world from an unthinkable fate. Features A Deep Single Player Story Campaign : the 40+ hour Single player campaign mode features a rich gripping plot woven with numerous historical events and characters to bring the terrifying reality of the Cold War to life from a unique perspective. Next-generation turn-based combat : offers unprecedented flexibility of movement and actions, including variable Overwatch modes and assault-oriented Breach ability. Expanded battlefield : assets can be positioned around the world, enabling you to call for assistance in the heat of battle. But the enemy can also bring in reinforcements, including heavy weapons and even air support. Don’t bring a knife to a gunfight. Knowledge is power : Improve your chances of success by infiltrating mission locations with undercover operatives. Attempt to stay one step ahead of enemy agents, who are also preparing to spring their own devious traps. Lurk in the shadows with fully-fledged stealth gameplay : Clandestine operations can be completed with muffled weapons, silent takedowns and cutting edge Cold War technology. Take charge of the crucial counterintelligence operation : Recruit from both the KGB and the CIA, the criminal fraternity, or even utilise the unique talents of subjects of secret government experiments. Weapons, resources and contacts can be secured around the globe, enabling you to command from afar. But if the situation requires a hands-on approach, you will be locked, loaded and ready to fight. Innovative Investigation Board : Utilizing a classic pinboard and string approach, the Investigation Board is the hub from where cases, locations and individuals can be researched to reveal new missions, resources and technologies. In Phantom Doctrine, investigation and intel is an active and vital element of success. Multiplayer Battles : lose friends and make new enemies in ruthless online multiplayer matches. Experience the deviousness and lethality of Phantom Doctrine in accessible 1v1 skirmishes. Utilize ruthless Technology : New capabilities can either be stolen from the enemy or researched, and then ruthlessly used to your advantage. Often experimental and morally dubious, brainwashing, interrogation, body engineering and chemical enhancement are all fair game as you extract information by any means necessary. Fully customizable character creation : Operatives can be customized each time they need a new identity. Change their appearance, forge their documents, train them in the deadly arts and send them back into the field. Carefully Designed hand-crafted levels : Combining the best of both worlds: the quality of large, hand-designed maps and meticulous, smart design ensuring visual and gameplay variety. Travel the world of the 1980s in the grip of the Cold War on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Replayable modular campaign : a wide array of mechanics ensures markedly different playthroughs. A unique experience is guaranteed by randomly generated character names and backgrounds, algorithmically populated and adapted maps, and randomized intelligence snippets. A spy thriller from two different points of view : Play as either a former KGB counterintelligence operative or a renegade CIA wet work commando. Each has to come to terms with the truth and challenge the global conspiracy. Complete the campaign to be rewarded with an additional protagonist in Extended Playthrough. No mission is too big or too small : whether infiltrating a busy government facility to clinically assassinate a target, or mounting a full frontal assault on an enemy base.

With your home planet destroyed and your people lost, it's up to you to keep Hope alive on a perilous adventure across the galaxy! Also... There’s a pig. You can pet the pig. That’s all you really need to know. As captain, you are responsible for taking care of the human needs of everyone on your ship. Everything from socializing, sleep, food, to water and air.

THE WORLD OF DEADSIDE The world of DEADSIDE is vast and filled with forests, rivers, and settlements. You can build anywhere outside of settlements.

MISSIONS Missions are a crucial part of progression. The world map will have them conveniently marked. Watchout for armed military groups and bandits, and high tier loot. WEAPONS AND COMBAT SYSTEM It's all about the ballistics and variety of weapons.  Choose from 32 firearms, and modify them with scopes, expanded mags, flashlights, silencers and other modules. Feeling tactical? Setup tripwire traps, respawn beacons, use smoke grenades for cover. The combat system is designed to be hardcore. TRADE and “SAFE ZONES” Store your loot in Safe Zones. Nobody can take it from there. Trade with friendly NPCs. Make friends with other players. The Safe Zones are your extraction point if you don't want to build a base.

Bolstering the forces of both The Empire and The Vampire Counts, it introduces famous rival characters and new iconic units from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles to your campaigns and battles. Two new Legendary Lords… …with new quest chains, magic items and skill trees Two new additional Lord types Five all-new battlefield units plus variants Five new battlefields for custom battles and multiplayer battles 18 elite Regiments of Renown Ever-devious and ever-ruthless, the Unliving Aristocracy summons forth horrifying new threats to unman the forces of The Empire. Smelling blood on the tainted air, the Strigoi Ghoul Kings stir from their stale catacombs, while Mannfred’s darkest student, Helman Ghorst, pauses in his damnable studies and readies the Corpse-Carts for battle. But the proud men of The Empire do not stand idly by in the face of such unholy threats. Even now the call goes out, and all eyes turn to Volkmar The Grim, Grand Theogonist of The Cult of Sigmar. Pious and forbidding, Karl Franz’ staunchest ally calls forth his Arch Lectors and rides into battle on the War Altar of Sigmar, a sight to strike terror even into the unbeating hearts of The Undead. Man versus vampire: legend versus legend. The Grim and The Grave. New Legendary Lords Volkmar The Grim Volkmar The Grim is the Grand Theogonist, the head of the Cult of Sigmar and the most powerful religious leader in the Empire. He is a pious and foreboding man who is utterly devoted to the destruction of Chaos in all its forms. When he accompanies an army into battle, he typically rides atop the resplendent War Altar of Sigmar, inspiring the soldiers around him to great acts of heroism as he strikes the followers of evil down with powerful blows and words of divine force. Volkmar is a holy terror on the battlefield, a man who fights with the fury of Sigmar himself. It is said that his soul is forged of steel, and he fights the malign influence of Chaos with every fibre of his being. Campaign bonuses When Volkmar leads a Grand Campaign, any Flagellant you recruit into his army will gain improvements to their weapon damage and charge bonus stats, and will be cheaper to recruit. Quests Volkmar may embark on quests to earn his Legendary items. The Jade Griffon provides a passive augment that regenerates Volkmar’s health, while the Staff of Command brings a number of improvements to Volkmar’s combat skills, public order management and post-battle loot income. Battle prayers Volkmar can unlock three Grand Battle Prayers to utter in combat, improving the offensive and defensive capabilities of himself and those around him. Unique mount When Volkmar has unlocked his Battle Prayers, he gains access to the War Altar of Sigmar, a resplendent fighting platform replete with a vast bronze Griffon bearing Ghal Maraz. Unique Skills Volkmar has the unique skills Para Bellum Aeturnus and Heretic Hunter, which improve the abilities of Flagellants and Warrior Priests in both battle and campaign. Helman Ghorst Helman Ghorst was once a man, yet that life was ripped from him. The loss of his father and brothers to plague sent Ghorst into an obsessive madness; he began studying the black arts in the hope of returning his lost kin to life. Coming to the attention of Mannfred von Carstein, the Count taught him necromancy, transforming Helman into something beyond the grief-maddened man from Templehof. Now, he is carried through the night on a bone-ridged cart, pulled not by horses, but by the brothers he so desperately wished to save – each a once-handsome farrier restored to a mockery of life, forced to stumble along at the head of their brother’s unloving host. Campaign bonuses When chosen to lead a Grand Campaign, Helman Ghorst confers a bonus to the casualty replenishment rate of all Vampire Counts armies. In addition, all units in Helman Ghorst’s army gain poison attacks. Quests Helman may embark upon a quest for The Liber Noctus, a legendary tome which weakens his enemies in battle, and enables him to use special abilities more frequently. Unique Mount Helman may unlock The Brothers Ghorst Corpse Cart. Drawn by the undead remnants of his brothers, this unique mount vastly improves his weapon strength and damage output. Unique Spell Awaken from the Grave, Helman’s unique spell, summons a unit of Grave Guard or, when upgraded, a Wight King to fight for him. Unique Skills Helman has the unique skill Leading from the Front which improves abilities of the plague-bearing Corpse Carts and the phantasmal Mortis Engine. New Lords Arch Lector The High Priest of the Cult of Sigmar is the Grand Theogonist, and beneath him are his two Arch Lectors - grim, imposing figures, both on and off the battlefield. It is the duty of Arch Lectors to protect the populace and cast out evil. They epitomise the warrior courage of Sigmar himself, leading from the front where they manifest the power of the gods and inspire whole armies to acts of heroism. Battle prayers Arch Lectors can learn three Grand Battle Prayers to aid their armies in combat. Hammer of Sigmar improves the Arch Lector’s melee attack skill. Shields of Faith is an area-effect augment for nearby allies, improving their damage resistance. Soulfire is a large area-effect offensive power, causing mass magical damage to enemy units. Strigoi Ghoul King The pallid creatures known as Ghoul Kings are in fact once-proud Strigoi Vampires forced into a troglodytic existence. Though all Strigoi descend from the same ancient lineage of Ushoran, they have devolved to become something far fouler and more hate-filled than their brethren. The Ghoul Kings spend their days creeping through the hidden places of the world, but under cover of night, they wreak their vengeance at the head of a shambling army of Undead. Powerful warriors and spellcasters, Strigoi Ghoul Kings wield a mixed lore combining spells from the Lore of Vampires and the Lore of Death, and may unlock and ride Terrorgheists into battle. Unique Spell Command of The Unliving, the Strigoi Ghoul King’s unique spell, summons a unit of Crypt Ghouls or, when upgraded, a unit of Crypt Horrors to fight for him in battle. New Units Corpse Cart Drawn by shambling zombies, Corpse Carts act like magnets for Dark Magic, drawing their power from the land itself and re-animating the dead around them. Sometimes a Corpse Cart is hung with a great bell, the clapper of which is a fell lodestone of eldritch provenance. When necromantic magic is thick in the air, the bell tolls and ripples of Dark Magic emanate from the Corpse Cart. As a magical support chariot, the Corpse Cart projects a magical aura known as the Vigor Mortis. This confers regeneration on the corpse cart and raises the melee attack of nearby undead units. With the Balefire upgrade, the Corpse Cart confers an increased chance to miscast on nearby enemy wizards. With the Unholy Lodestone upgrade, the Corpse Cart confers an area-effect regeneration augment on nearby friendly undead units. Mortis Engine The remains of Necromancers and Liche Lords are sometimes enshrined within a Mortis Engine, a cage of fused bone surrounded by trappings of grandeur, and borne to war by a host of spirits bound to the infernal device. Heavy with evil magics and painstakingly illuminated, the Blasphemous Tome the Mortis Engine bears has been crafted with such care that their creator's souls have passed into the leaves of human skin that form its pages. These books can be a boon to the twisted practitioners of necromancy. As a magical support chariot, the Mortis Engine Regenerates hitpoints for itself and nearby friendly undead units, and causes magical damage to nearby enemy units within the same radius. The attendant Blasphemous Tome also increases the owner’s Winds of Magic power reserve. Upon destruction, the Mortis Engine explodes in a cataclysm of arcane energy, causing widespread damage to nearby friends and foes. Free Company Militia While state troops form the mainstay of the Empire’s military forces, its armies are often bulked out by ad-hoc regiments of militia who are recruited to fight as and when required. No one can foretell how many will turn up at the muster, or what their fighting quality will be. After all, these irregular troops receive no formal training or discipline. Free Company Militia are dual-role hybrid troops. Armed with both short-range pistols and swords, the can fight as the situation demands. With the Vanguard Deployment ability, they can be deployed deep in the field. Flagellants When battle is joined, bands of crazed Flagellants beat themselves into a frenzy before charging headlong towards the enemy. They throw themselves into the fray without hesitation, against the most hopeless of odds. With howls of doom on their lips and visions of martyrdom in their thoughts, Flagellants fight with wild ferocity, swinging their flails at their enemies and leaving trails of blood and woe in their wake. Flagellants are both Frenzied and Unbreakable. Their Strength of the Penitent special ability super-charges their fighting skills, conferring enhanced physical resistance and melee defence. Knights of The Blazing Sun The Templar order of The Blazing Sun pride themselves on learning the very arts and sciences of war. Resplendent on their armoured mounts, they fight in the name of Myrmidia, the very goddess of warfare. For generations they have fought devoutly for the honour and sanctity of the Empire. Powerful shock cavalry akin to the famous Reiksguard, the Knights of The Blazing Sun carry glinting shields which blind those wishing to cause them harm. This confers a certain resistance to magical damage. Their righteous zeal also grants them flaming attacks. Regiments of Renown These are elite units – legendary within the annals of the Old World – whose statistics are much-improved over those of their standard counterparts. They can be unlocked for recruitment when the Lord under your command has attained the sufficient skill level, and are instantly recruited from the special Regiments of Renown recruitment menu into his army. In this respect they differ from standard units, which spend at least one turn in the recruitment queue. Alongside enhanced stats, each Regiment of Renown also has one or more special abilities its standard-roster counterpart does not. Please note: unit abilities and details subject to change. Empire The Tattersouls - Flagellants Increased unit size This brotherhood of zealots is led by the crazed prophet Gerhard The Worm, who fought alongside Volkmar in the war against The Everchosen. Little remains of his personality now but the raw fervour which drives his men. Stirland’s Revenge – Free Company Militia Stalk, armour piercing missiles, immune to psychology A shower of growling ne’er-do-wells, the ragged militia of Stirland’s Revenge are always spoiling for a fight. What they lack in personal hygiene, they more than make up for in their thirst for vengeance against the undead. Hammer of The Witches – Great Cannon Enhanced physical resistance, shells cause magical damage A single regiment is all that remains of Fort Oberstyre’s once-formidable batteries. The Hammer of The Witches earned its name in service of the town of Gortansford, tearing The Grey Hag to shreds with hastily-improvised grapeshot-rounds of horseshoes. Sigmar’s Sons - Swordsmen Unbreakable Sigmar’s Sons originally served in The Red Masquers, a regiment that fought alongside Volkmar against the Norscans. They are Veteran warriors and merciless killers to a man, fearless in the face of evil. Silver Bullets – Handgunners Stalk, bullets deal magical damage Prior to battle, their foul-mouthed quartermaster Curser Brecht hands each of these marksmen a single silver bullet, granting them proof against whatever Sylvania may throw against them. Whether real or imagined, these good-luck charms seem to work… The Sunmaker – Helstorm Rocket Battery Flaming attacks, Increased number of missiles per volley The final invention of the scatterbrained Talabheim alchemist Jurgen Bugelstrauss before his untimely demise, The Sunmaker fires specialist phosphoric rockets that burn with a blinding brilliance. The Templehof Luminark – Luminark of Hysh Encourage, Net of Amyntok Crafted by Jovi Sunscryer, most experienced of the White Wizards, The lenses of the Templehof Luminark are ground to perfection and offer an unmatched degree of focus. The Royal Altdorf Gryphites – Demigryphs Cause terror At the head of the Drakwald Riders, the Royal Altdorf Gryphites are among the finest of The Order’s inner-circle of cavalrymen. Zintler’s Reiksguard – Reiksguard Vanguard Deployment Led by the Reiksmarshal Hans Zintler, the long and oft-storied history of this proud order has given them a peerless positional perspective. Masters of the flanking manoeuvre, their enemies find themselves under savage assault before the battle has been joined in earnest. Vampire Counts The Feasters in The Dusk – Crypt Ghouls Stalk, vanguard deployment Most Crypt Ghouls are only too eager to pound towards their foes for the meal they represent. The Feasters in The Dusk are uncharacteristically measured in their approach, preferring to advance in stealthy fashion before lunging at their prey from the shadows. The Devils of Shwartzhafen – Vargheists Vanguard Deployment These once-handsome sons of the Von Carstein dynasty, trapped for long years in the warpstone-tainted caverns below Castle Swartzhafen, bear no trace of their former intellect. Now, they haunt the night at Mannfred’s behest, tearing his opponents to bloody rags. The Direpack – Dire Wolves Bonus VS large, increased mass and size Uncommonly ferocious, these grossly muscled fiends eschew smaller targets in favour of foes large enough to satisfy their ravenous appetites. The Sternsmen – Grave Guard Regeneration In life, these cursed warriors were the honour guard of Verek The Blade, First Castellan of Sternieste. In death, they fight with an unholy zeal which resists the blows of their foes. The Tithe – Zombies Increased size and physical resistance These once-proud fighting men of Sylvania, now reduced to shambling servants of The Midnight Aristocracy, are physically superior to ‘civilian’ zombies in every way The Chillgheists – Hexwraiths Magical Resistance, slowing aura Guardians of the Necropolis of Vargravia, The Chillgheists draw power from the cursed land and instil a blasphemous resolve in their cold-hearted brethren. The Claw of Nagash – Mortis Engine Magical Resistance, slowing aura It is said that the huge ironbone reliquary of this Mortis Engine contains the withered but still-moving hand of Nagash himself, lending it the unholy power to ward off enemy magics. Verek’s Reavers – Black Knights Regeneration Cursed to fight for the Wight King Verek The Blade, these cavalry are seemingly unstoppable, their limbs reattaching and shattered bones remade before their opponents’ startled eyes.

Hunt the mightiest monsters of the Old World and tame them to your cause Massive new roster with unique monstrous units including War Mammoths and Frost-Wyrms Slow your foes with the chilling Frostbite combat ability Tear through your enemies with new Rage and Berserk abilities Description In the far north, between the Chaos Wastes and the Sea of Claws, lies Norsca. A barren, inhospitable peninsula in the far north of the Old World, it is home to ferocious tribes of warriors, hardened by the relentless blizzards, the barren icy tundra and the monstrous denizens of this accursed land. Fanatical servants of the dark gods, they will stop at nothing to prove their primal might, in a relentless hunt for worthy foes and fresh raiding grounds. Playstyle A Norscan campaign is one of relentless pillage and ruination. Their principle sources of income are raiding and sacking. This lends itself to a very mobile and combative playstyle – always keeping your armies on the move and often in contention with other factions. Razing settlements enables you to erect monoliths to the dark gods of Norsca… and the gods always reward the faithful! In battle, Norscan armies are swift and vicious, featuring a backbone of increasingly fierce and more heavily armed Marauder infantry units. With the right buildings in place, they can also recruit a wide array of monstrous units such as Trolls, Fimir Warriors, Norscan Ice Wolves and Skin Wolves. At the top of the tree are the Frost-Wyrm and the colossal War Mammoth. Unique Norsca Mechanics Allegiance to the gods When conquering a settlement, Norscan factions have a unique new post-battle option. Alongside Occupying and Looting, they may choose to Raze a settlement and erect a monolith to one of the four dark gods, who they personify as the Eagle, the Crow, the Serpent and the Hound. The more monoliths that are erected, the more favour the gods bestow. Rewards are granted in the form of increasingly powerful campaign and battle bonuses and, in certain cases, unique units or characters. Victory Conditions By pledging your allegiance to a god fully and securing its final and greatest reward, you trigger the road to campaign victory. The gods are jealous, and the three you have spurned will not take kindly. They will dispatch their most powerful champions to challenge your supremacy, activating a series of quests which culminate in an epic endgame experience. Monster hunting When the Monster Hunter skill is unlocked in the tech tree, a Norsca faction gains access to the Monstrous Arcanum. This ancient tome lists the mightiest beasts and monsters to roam the world. The player may then choose to initiate hunts, embarking on multi-stage quests which culminate in battles against these legendary creatures. Once defeated, they may bestow legendary trophies which the player may equip his characters with. In certain cases, the monsters themselves may be brought to heel and recruited for use in battle. Frostbite A number of frost-imbued units appear in the roster, such as Norscan Ice Wolves and Norscan Ice Trolls, with the passive ability Frostbite. This new effect significantly slows units engaged in melee, making it considerably easier to run down routers or those attempting to manoeuvre. Similarly, the mighty Frost-Wyrm has the Chilling Aura ability, a constant effect slowing the movement speed of nearby enemy units. Dominate! Confederate the Norscan tribes by defeating their Faction Leaders in battle. Such a show of supremacy will make them much more amenable to accepting your rule! Outposts Marauder Outposts can be established in conquered coastal settlements outside of Norsca. These provide basic recruitment options and act as handy replenishment-stops for your marauding armies. Securing major faction capitals outside Norsca – such as Altdorf, Castle Drakenhof and so on – allows you to build fully-developed Norscan settlements. Ownership of these cities also enables you to plunder the secrets of their original owners, unlocking unique new technologies to research. New Legendary Lords A Norsca campaign may be led by one of two Legendary Lords: Wulfrik The Wanderer, leader of the Norsca faction, or Throgg, King of the Trolls and leader of the Wintertooth faction. Each begins play in a different starting position and bring their own unique suite of campaign and battle bonuses. Wulfrik The Wanderer Wulfrik is a relentless executioner. He roams land and sea, an awe-inspiring figure draped with the skulls of his conquests. He has slain dragons and kings, highborn lords and beasts of legend. None may refuse the challenge he delivers – and in their own tongue, no less. Wulfrik is a powerful leader and duellist with unique skills, quest-chains and legendary items. He has the Siege Attacker attribute, enabling him to ignore the requirement for siege engines or siege weapons before attacking walled settlements. All Mammoth units in his army gain bonus Melee Attack, all Marauder units enjoy reduced Upkeep Costs, and every unit in his retinue causes Fear. Wulfrik also has a personal combat ability called Seafang, named after his fabled ship; a powerful and far-reaching wind attack. Carefully placed, it can stagger and slay numerous foes. In battle, his Hunter of Champions skill enables him to pin enemy characters in place while he fights them. Throgg Trolls are widely known not just for their physical power, but also their striking lack of intelligence. It is this that sets Throgg apart from the rest of his kind, for he is gifted with a rare intelligence for his grotesque kind. Behind his snaggle-toothed visage lies a ruthless cunning that Throgg employs to bring the bitter chill of the north to the lands of man. Throgg is a powerful leader and melee fighter with unique skills, quest-chains and legendary items. As the King of the Trolls, Throgg brings reduced upkeep to Troll and Ice Troll units, and units in Throgg’s army are immune to all forms of attrition. He also grants a Physical Resistance buff to all Troll and Ice Troll units factionwide. If Throgg captures the settlement of Eringrad in Troll Country, he may build a unique building there – the Cave of the Rocky Throne – which grants buffs to Troll units factionwide. Throgg also has a uniquely Trollish magic missile attack called Copious Vomit New Lord Marauder Chieftain Leaders of the Norscan armies, Marauder Chieftains boast unique sequences of personal specialisations in their skills trees, enabling them to truly excel in certain aspects of battle, and culminating is powerful active and passive abilities which transform their effectiveness in battle. Each of these specialisation paths is aligned with one of the four Norscan gods, and the nature of these abilities is inspired by their aspect. Chieftains can also unlock a series of mounts, culminating in the mighty War Mammoth. New Heroes Norsca players armies may recruit three new types of Hero units to support their armies and perform Campaign Map actions. Skin Wolf Werekin These hulking beasts are superior to their Skin Wolf kin in every way. As well as being powerful, anti-large focused warriors, they also have two unique, mutually exclusive skill-paths which grant them strong offensive or defensive combat-support buffs to nearby enemy units. Shaman Sorcerer (Lores of Death, Metal Fire) The sorcerers of Norsca may be recruited to specialise in the Lores of Metal, Fire or Death. However, once a Norscan, always a Norscan… these are no weakling mages! They gain melee attack improvements and may be mounted on chariots. Fimir Balefiend (Lores of Shadows, Fire) Fimir Balefiends may be adept magic-users, but their impressive stature and musculature also make them powerful fighters. These dual-role heroes work best in the thick of battle, casting spells and supporting the troops with their combat abilities. Fimir also have magical attacks and sunder armour.

Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported! - OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account. - Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!) Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase! Overview OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type. Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease! OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip) Features Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.) Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you. Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you. Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world. Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!) Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them. Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click. Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!) Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage. Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch! Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings! Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly! Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too) Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification. Macros: Create macro keybinds which can be activated by a click on the wrist to trigger a series of key presses. (Such as changing OBS scenes, muting/un-muting Discord, etc.) Paste to Game: Clicking the Paste button found under the keyboard will automatically tab in the currently running game and push Ctrl and V. (Can be used to paste links into VRChat video players, paste join codes into codes, etc.) Customization Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI. Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI. Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications. Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!) Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made. Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode 'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game! (This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!) Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected. Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input. Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.) Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games. Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack) Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected. Important stuff you should know about We've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works! Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing: OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you) OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10) Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki! Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard) Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games! We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!) Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix! Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020) If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us!

The Old Ones lost, but their mantle was inherited by one of their creations—the Aeldari, a psychically-powerful race of immense sensitivity. Over the subsequent millenia, they ruled the galaxy, slipping over time deeper and deeper into depravity and arrogance. Their golden age ended with the birth of Slaanesh, the Chaos God of pleasure. At the moment of her birth, the core of the Aeldari civilization was utterly destroyed, its citizens’ souls and even its pantheon all but consumed by the nascent god. Where the Aeldari homeworlds once were, now there is only the Eye of Terror, a massive rift into the Warp. Only a few Aeldari survived: the hardy Exodites; the degenerate Drukhari and mysterious Harlequins, hiding in the Webway; and the restrained Aeldari, on enormous ships known as Craftworlds.

Like this game's name mentions, this is a cyber-puzzle game which is combined with the network of violence , big data , loss of privacy and other social problems . Many plots of this series game relate to real events . So you can find many familiar stories in your life as Deja-vu scene. Theme In our creative process, we found that the Internet is more important in our life than everyone's imagination. Social events always have different opinions in the real world. And there is always has a little group of people who enjoy judging others, and because of that, the events would be more complicated, even leading emergencies to happen. When information flow quickly transforms in every place of the world, immorality and illegal news always happen. In this process, more and more people enjoy being judging process. After careful consideration, we decided to make an amazing game to let people really know about the dangers of internet world. We focus on the dark web , truly cybercrime and privacy burglary , tried to let gamers can experience being a hacker in the real world. Every little operation would affect the life of the characters in the game, which would let you rethink the relationship between people and the internet. Features You can do some really hack in our game: ·Web search You should collect basic information about the targets through the Internet search. ·Database You can use the database to get deep information about targets. ·Crack You would get passwords based on the obtained target's information, and use it to log in to accounts of different platforms (including email, social media, chat application, etc.) ·Chat The exciting thing is that you need to chat with targets by disguise and use the information to get the trust of the target. ·Picture Analysis You can get valuable information and relevant clues from pictures. ·Phishing You can send phishing links to hack the targets' hardware devices (computer, mobile phone), and get private information. More advanced hacking methods will be unlocked later! Gameplay ·Highly Immersive Gamers play as a hacker in the game, accepts the commission of the company, and solve dangerous incidents. ·Rich Gameplay There are lots of features of Social Engineering in the game, which is including Detecting, Tracking, Puzzles-Solving, Destroying and Hacking etc.. ·Complex Story The game will judge the good and evil of the player's behavior. Different judgments will lead to different plot directions. ·Multiple Roles There are many different roles in this game with a flash of personality. Their stories would be dug by yourself. Written in the end When we decided on the subject matter of the game, we thought about it for a long time. Because of This War of Mine , Papers, Please , Orwell and other excellent indie games, we also want to make a game that allows gamers to think outside the game. We tried so many times to brainstorm. We set up a Social Engineering group to find some experts and ask them about the skills for giving gamers a real hacking experience. We even read the book The Art of Deception written by the famous hacker Kevin David Mitnick to figure out how a real hacker's works. These studies directly opened the door to a new world for all of us. The disciplines involved social engineering, psychology, micro-expressions, phrase skills and so on, which kinds of studies make us have great confidence in the theme of the game and gameplay. Not just professionals and books, we also get inspiration from cinema. For example, through Who Am I: No System Is Safe , we have seen another explanation about hacking skills. Through Searching we have learned how to create storytelling in details and how to let the audiences and games focus on where we expect them to focus. Every times learning makes us closer to the game in my heart. So as we mentioned before, this game is very special and unique which combines a lot of creativity. I really hope that you guys could like this game so much.

The Golden Era of open-wheel racing is about to begin. Do you have what it takes to lead an iconic team through one of the most exciting decades of motorsport history? As the head of a team, you'll make pivotal decisions that shape the destiny of your drivers and the performance of your cars. Allocate your budget wisely across drivers, support staff, car development, and sponsorships to gain an edge over the competition. Manage big personalities to get the most out of every member of your team. But don’t forget – r acing in this era is unpredictable and intense. Golden Lap is no ordinary motorsport management game. Safety measures are improving, but accidents can happen. Car technology is advancing in leaps and bounds. You aren’t racing spreadsheets, and there’s no such thing as a guaranteed win – which makes victory all the sweeter. Lead Your Team To Pole Position Every season is an opportunity to etch your name in racing history. Whether you're turning a back-marker team into a championship contender or taking on the pressure of maintaining a dynasty, your decisions between races and championships will be the key to your legacy. Hire the right crew, develop your cars, make the right calls on race day, and meet your sponsors’ goals. All while making sure not to go broke! Your Legacy Awaits Build a winning team with drivers, a head engineer and a crew chief. Every hire comes with rich personality traits that affect everything from finances to car performance and skill behind the wheel. A driver with rich parents may look like they’ve saved your team by helping out with money - until they turn out to be a party animal and cost you the championship by showing up tired on race day. Your head engineer might bring down the rest of your team with their grumpy attitude, but if they’re a magician with a wrench it might be worth it? Only you can judge what your team needs. Minimalist Style, Maximum Strategy Golden Lap is a minimalist take on the racing strategy genre, with an intuitive UI that displays only essential information and makes it clear what each decision means – though it won’t make the decisions themselves any easier!

If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection! Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit. Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests' experience.

Bolstering the forces of both The Greenskins and The Dwarfs, it introduces famous rival characters, new iconic units and new battle maps from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles to your Grand Campaigns and Custom/Multiplayer battles. Two new Legendary Lords…. …with new quest chains, magic items and skill trees Two new additional Lord types Six all-new battlefield units 22 all-new elite Regiments of Renown The time is nigh for Clan Angrund to reclaim Karak Eight Peaks from the Grobi despoilers! Belegar Ironhammer, clan leader and direct descendant of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to rule the ancestral hold, has inherited a bitter legacy of hatred and resentment. Even now he marshals his throng, making ready to strike out from Karak Izor. With the spirits of his fabled ancestors returned to fight by his side, Belegar will see his oaths fulfilled, and pass into legend himself. Meanwhile Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed Night-Goblin warlord of Karak Eight Peaks, has taken leave of the hold. On a squig-hunting excursion in the Grey Mountains east of Brettonia, he operates from his base at Karak Azgaraz when word reaches him of Belegar’s intent. Worse still, the tricksy Goblins minding Karak Eight Peaks have taken the hold in defiance of Skarsnik’s iron will. Intolerable, sneaky, mutinous gits! Two legends, then: both hell-bent on claiming the ancient Dwarf-Hold for themselves. Their destinies entwined, The King and the Warlord must face one another in a final, desperate battle to determine the true ruler of Karak Eight Peaks. New Legendary Lords Belegar Ironhammer, True King of The Eight Peaks Ancestral heir of Karak Eight Peaks, King Belegar has a terrible and glorious destiny to fulfil. He has sworn an oath to reclaim the fallen Dwarf Hold from the Greenskin usurpers, despite the mountainous odds he faces. Karak Eight Peaks represents more than Belegar’s birthright however. In terms of prestige and wealth it is second only to Karaz-a-Karak itself, and if Belegar can reclaim it in the name of Clan Angrund, he will gain access to the ancestral tombs and the rich trove of ancient and powerful rune-weapons which lies within… Unique start-position Belegar begins the Grand Campaign with ownership of the walled settlement of Karak Izor in Border Princes territory. Campaign bonuses When chosen to lead a Grand Campaign, Belegar begins play with the spirits of his Ancestors as his companion Heroes. King Lunn The Ironhammer (Thane), Halkenhaf Stonebeard (Thane), Dramar Hammerfist (Master Engineer) and Throni Ironbrow (Runesmith) are Ethereal Heroes, with all the benefits the Ethereal trait provides. Belegar gains early access to the new Dwarf Rangers through the Ranger Outpost building. He also has the Siege Attacker trait, enabling him to attack walled cities without building siege equipment first. Until he captures Karak Eight Peaks however, Belegar suffers increased unit upkeep costs to his army. Quests Belegar may embark on quests to attain his two legendary items, The Shield of Defiance, and the powerful ancestral rune-weapon The Hammer of Angrund. Skarsnik, Warlord of The Eight Peaks Skarsnik is the chieftain of the Crooked Moon Tribe, and is widely acknowledged as the most powerful Night Goblin in the World’s Edge Mountains. This reputation was earned through devious machinations, relentless spite, and a wholesale brutality rare even among his pernicious race. A vicious melee fighter in his own right, what makes him truly formidable is his favoured pet, the Giant Cave Squig Gobbla. The beast’s colossal teeth and voracious appetite make it a horrifying spectacle on the battlefield; to Gobbla, enemy units are as much a perambulating smorgasboard as a physical foe. Unique start-position Skarsnik begins in Karak Azgaraz in the West Grey Mountains, having left Karak Eight Peaks to go Squig hunting. Campaign bonuses When chosen to lead a Grand Campaign, Skarsnik begins play with his vicious Giant Cave Squig Gobbla, who never leaves his side, and a Goblin Big Boss hero. Skarsnik also has unique skills which buff Goblin units, bring reduced upkeep costs for Goblin units, and his particularly sneaky nature means his Heroes’ actions cost less and garner greater experience gains. Skarsnik can only recruit Orcs in Karak Eight Peaks however, which he must first recapture from mutinous elements of his tribe. Quests Skarsnik may embark upon a quest for his legendary weapon, Skarsnik’s Prodder. This vicious, halberd-style weapon is capable of unleashing an area-affect burst of powerful magic missiles. New Lords Runelord Dwarfen Runelords are among the most skilled practitioners of the Runic Arts. As they lead their armies into battle, they call upon the power of these runes to invigorate friendly units and hinder their foes. Runelords also have access to a new mount; at level 6, they may unlock and ride The Anvil of Doom into battle. This unique chariot empowers the Runelord’s runic abilities and increases his damage resistance. Night Goblin Warboss Spiteful, conniving and capricious, Night Goblin Warbosses can unlock unique skills which enhance the capabilities of Goblin, Night Goblin and Squig units, and imbue their entire army with poison attacks. At level 12, they can be mounted on Great Cave Squigs, providing the Warboss with greater damage resistance, speed and attack power. New units Crooked Moon Squig herd War beasts, Anti-infantry, Vanguard Deployment Found in the caves deep beneath the World’s Edge Mountains, Squigs are improbable beasts. Part fungus and part flesh with spheroid bodies and a hopping gait, one might view them from a distance as comical. In close proximity however, they are anything but. As their beady eyes fasten on a target, they bound forward pell-mell, opening their gaping maws to reveal row upon row of dagger-like teeth. Prodded into battle by their Night Goblin herders, they make a swift and vicious anti-infantry force. Night Goblin Squig Hoppers Cavalry, anti-infantry, Vanguard Deployment, Poison Attacks It takes a particularly unhinged individual to leap atop a Squig and ride it into battle. Fortunately, this is a defining characteristic of Night Goblins. Goaded onward by their squawking, cackling riders, such Squigs are driven at breakneck speed – swifter than their unsaddled counterparts – and consequently strike with renewed ferocity. Nasty Skulkers Sneaky infantry, Vanguard Deployment, Stalk, Armour Piercing Nobody skulks like a Goblin, and the Nasty Skulkers are the very skulkiest. Armed with razor-sharp daggers, they sneak deep into the field before a battle and lie in wait. When the time is right, they leap out and strike, causing lethal armour piercing damage before scurrying away under a confounding cloud of smoke. It’s all too easy to dismiss the average goblin as a spineless wretch, but when a Nasty Skulker springs from nowhere to land on your shoulders, it’s enough to challenge your assumptions… should you survive the encounter. Clan Angrund Rangers (upgradeable with Great Weapons) Ranged/melee, fast, Vanguard Deployment, can Stalk The long-range eyes and ears of a Dwarf Throng, Rangers are accustomed to operating alone, often deep in enemy territory.  Expert crossbowmen, they make superb ambushers – waiting patiently for the enemy to manoeuvre into their firing lines before letting fly with a cloud of thudding bolts. Should the enemy draw close, they are well-drilled melee combatants too, especially when armed with Great Weapons. Bugman’s Rangers Ranged/melee, fast, Vanguard Deployment, can Stalk Eternal vengeance-seekers for the destruction of their master’s fabled brewery, these veteran warriors often arrive unannounced before a battle to bear grim tidings, before joining the Throng for the fight ahead. They are peerless Rangers in their own right, though the unit never travels without the fortifying power of Bugman’s most potent brews. Such liquid fortification can transform their fighting abilities. Bolt Thrower Field artillery, armour-piercing Tried and true, many clans still employ the Bolt Thrower, a war machine the Dwarfs have used since the days of the Ancestor Gods. Essentially oversized crossbows, they are accurate and reliable, hurling massive, razor-sharp bolts capable of piercing even the toughest armour. New Unique building Chain The settlement of Karak Eight Peaks offers a unique Karak Eight Peaks building chain, the benefits of which differ depending on whether it is captured by Clan Angrund or The Crooked Moon Tribe. If built by Clan Angrund, the benefits are as follows: Level 1 focuses on making Karak Eight Peaks more defensible, giving unit stat bonuses when under siege. Level 2 focuses on rebuilding the Karak, giving large public order bonuses, unit experience for various units and reductions in corruption. Level 3 marks the recovery of the Ancestor Tombs, and supplies Ancestor Weapons for military units in nearby provinces, imbuing them with magical attacks. Level 3 also ramps up unit experience and public order bonuses. If built by The Crooked Moon Tribe, the benefits are as follows: Level 1 focuses on making Karak Eight Peaks unassailable, as The Tribe expects Clan Angrund to attempt to retake it. This confers a massive siege holdout time       bonus and zero attrition suffered during sieges. Level 2 confers Obedience bonuses to the region and enhances unit experience for Goblins. Level 3 gives starting-level bonus experience to heroes, global experience gains for all units and reduces Dwarf morale in surrounding regions. New Dwarf Building Chain Ranger Outpost (T1) -> Ranger Barracks (T3) The Ranger chain initially provides recruitment of crossbow-wielding rangers, and later, Rangers armed with Great Weapons, and the elite Bugman’s Rangers.

Your grandmother left you a small cafe in the sleepy village of Caterwaul Way, and it's up to you to fix the place up, impress the locals, and befriend the local cat population. Time to roll up your sleeves, break out the tools, and start hammering away. Your cat cafe can be the talk of the town with the right attitude, menu, and of course, the right cats. That's right, Caterwaul Way is home to a plethora of extraordinary felines. The cafe can become their home, to the delight and relief of the villagers. Who knows, maybe their presence will loosen tongues and help you discover the secrets of Caterwaul Way... cats and take them off the streets, giving them a home. The cafe is run-down and abandoned by the time you arrive, but it's nothing that a little bit of elbow grease (and money) can't fix. Renovate the cafe, then decorate and expand it as you see fit and create a welcoming place for cats - and people - to relax in! Build up a capable staff by hiring the right people, managing their workload, and helping them refine their skills. Refine your cafe experience further with custom dishes and other menu items, catering to your customer's needs. A good cafe is more than just a restaurant with good food and drinks. The difference lies in relationships. At Caterwaul Way, that means befriending cats and townsfolk alike. Befriend and build relationships with a diverse cast of local villagers, such as Finley, a young musician trying to make it big, or Bonner, the local ferryman who's got some very tall stories to tell. Look after the local cats, befriend, and, eventually, adopt them. Each stray cat is unique and will make your cafe a little different. Keep your human and feline friends happy to unlock clues and eventually learn the secrets of Caterwaul Way. Caterwaul Way has a long and mysterious history - and many festivals celebrating it. If you want your cat cafe to become a staple of the village, plan accordingly! Travel the town, interact with the locals, and discover new recipes and opportunities for your cafe. And, if all goes well, maybe you'll crack the mystery of the crumbling, ancient shrine to an old feline god in the forests near Caterwaul Way...", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "Roost Games", "publisher": "Roost Games", "game_tag": "Simulation", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 500 MB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 64-bit"},

Introducing Malus Darkblade and Deathmaster Snikch both with their own objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle. Two richly themed and unique Legendary Lords lead their own factions: Malus Darkblade leads Hag Graef - for the Dark Elves, and Deathmaster Snikch leads Clan Eshin for the Skaven. Each Legendary Lord brings their own unique faction mechanics, quest-chains, legendary items, skill-trees and campaign narrative. Adds new powerful units and heroes for both Dark Elves and the Skaven. Lethal chariots and pain-wracked Medusae for the sadistic warmongers of Hag Graef. Cunning stealth magic, warp-infused weapon teams and deadly covert infantry for the assassin-inspired units of Clan Eshin. Features new elite Regiments of Renown to lay catastrophic waste to your enemies across the New and Old Worlds. Both Lords can be used in campaign, custom and battle modes. And are also playable in Mortal Empires, the massive free campaign available to owners of both Total War: WARHAMMER and Total War: WARHAMMER II. Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, escaped from his eternal prison within the Chaos Wastes, only to end up bound inseparably with the with the very being who freed him, the violent and cruel Malus Darkblade. Sensing the potential of this Daemonic entity, the Nightlord of Clan Eshin has dispatched his most trusted assassin, Deathmaster Snikch, to track down the Daemon and uncover its true power. Malus Darkblade (Hag Graef) Unique faction mechanics Possession In order to counteract his possession by Tz’arkan, Malus must continually drink an elixir that slows the Daemon’s influence over his mind. While the elixir is costly to consume, his master Malekith will gladly provide him with the recipe, but only if he helps him in his bid to control the Vortex. Despite the obvious danger in allowing the Drinker of Worlds to take control of his mind, there are situations in battle when Malus might benefit from letting the possession overcome him momentarily; greatly amplifying even his legendary viciousness. However, managing such an addiction to seemingly endless power, confronts Malus with desperate challenges throughout his campaign, as he seeks to wrestle back control of his very soul. Darkblade’s Expedition Malus starts the game in control of the mighty city of Hag Graef, while also in command of an expedition force supported by a Black Ark, on the other side of the world. In the opening stages of this campaign, the player is faced with a dilemma to either retain control of Hag Graef or give up the city in return for a hefty sum. With an offer Darkblade will find difficult to refuse, you’ll need to choose between two distinct campaign starts. Juggling the machinations Tz’arkan’s Whispers Malus Darkblade is the embodiment of hate and ruthlessness, qualities spurred by the evil brutality of the Daemon Tz’arkan. As Malus struggles in a constant inner-fight with the Daemon, it will attempt to influence him to perform acts of unthinkable slaughter and cruelty. As part of a new mission system, Malus can follow the Daemon’s dark whispers in return for unique and powerful rewards in the form of items, followers and other treasures. New units and characters Malus Darkblade (Legendary Lord) In battle, Malus is a heavily armoured close-quarters combatant who excels at dealing armour piercing damage thanks to his powerful Warpsword of Khaine. He rides a ferocious Cold One, called Spite, into battle and instils fear upon his enemies, making him a terrifying opponent on the battlefield. Malus has the unique yet costly ability to transform into the Daemon Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds.This ability refills his health, augments his stats and significantly alters his abilities in battle. High Beastmaster (Lord) The Dark Elves have long been experts at bending beasts and animals to their will, and the High Beastmasters are those that show even greater talent and aptitude. In particular, Beastmasters have considerable anti-large capabilities, making them a powerful tool when facing enemies that bring numberous large units into battle. Master (Hero) Dark Elf Masters are the lesser nobles of Dark Elf society. Adept with both spear and shield, these Heroes are capable of inflicting great damage to large targets, but are also capable of soaking up the most gruesome of blows thanks to their high melee defence and Guardian ability which protects nearby characters. Scourgerunner Chariot Quick and deadly, these war machines tear across the battlefield looking to hunt down new prey to kill or enslave. Equipped with powerful harpoons, they are a dedicated monster-hunting unit, capable of bringing down even the mightiest of beasts. Bloodwrack Medusa Bound in pain-wracked serpentine bodies, the Bloodwrack Medusa is a terrifying sight to behold on the battlefield. These writhing, horrid monsters are best positioned behind the front line to maximise their powerful ranged attacks to decimate foes. However,  they can match their ranged skill with ruthless melee capabilities, granting them a useful hybrid role while also causing fear and terror to enemy units. Bloodwrack Shrine Propelled by Dark Magic, the Bloodwrack Shrine grinds along the battlefield, inspiring allies and demoralising foes with its passive Aura of Agony and Aura of Ardour abilities. From her elevated position, the Medusa riding it has a far greater vantage point from which to cast her deadly gaze. The Siren of Red Ruin (Bloodwrack Medusa – Regiment of Renown) The Siren of Red Ruin is fear incarnate. This unique Medusa can call upon a damaging area-of-effect ability which tears apart enemy units in a radius around her, making for an extremely dangerous foe in close-combat. Ravagers of Rakarth (Scorgerunner Chariot – Regiment of Renown) The Ravagers of Rakarth are Clar Karond’s most elite Scourgerunner unit. Always thirsting for new quarry, this anti-large chariot is additionally armed with barbed nets that that slow enemy units in order to increase its killing potential. The Crows of Khaine (Harpies – Regiment of Renown) Harpies are always on the lookout for the next meal and the Crows of Khaine are the most ravenous. They provide regeneration abilities in exchange for damage dealt, increasing their survivability and causing terror in enemy units as they guzzle down the entrails of their victims. Deathmaster Snikch Unique faction mechanics Shadowy Dealings Deathmaster Snikch and his agents are the most feared secret operatives in the world, capable of subterfuge actions that few others possess. Using any of their Eshin characters, Clan Eshin can perform numerous Shadowy Dealing actions against their rivals on the campaign map, with 100% success. Actions have a wide range of outcomes including the simple theft of items or money, all the way to spying, inciting rebellions, and assassination,. The Deathmaster himself is even able to burn down entire cities! Greater Clan Contracts Skavendom’s unseen leaders are forever seeking to disrupt and backstab each other on the Council of Thirteen. When a problem arises that needs serious attention, the Greater Clans approach Clan Eshin to do their dirty work. These Clan Contracts allow Clan Eshin to receive money, food and increased reputation with the issuing clans, thus granting bonuses and reducing the cost of the Greater Clans’ specialized units. New units and characters Deathmaster Snikch (Legendary Lord) With unmatched stealth abilities and immense duelling prowess, Deathmaster Snikch excels at fighting other characters, especially when they are vulnerable and have already taken damage. Armed with his deadly Weeping Blades, he can instantly reduce a target’s armour by 50% on contact. Snikch also has the Vanguard Deployment and Stalk abilities, further cementing his role as the foremost Master Assassin of the Skaven. Master Assassin (Lord) Following in Snikch’s example, the Master Assassin excels at battling opposition characters in close combat but can also rely on their ranged shuriken attack to take enemies out from a distance. Their wide range of abilities such as Vanguard Deployment, Stalk and Concealment Bombs make them lethal ambush commanders to unleash upon your enemy. Eshin Sorcerer (Hero) Masters in the art of silent death, Eshin Sorcerers use the Lore of Stealth to support their allies from the rear of the battlefield. This new magic lore has a focus on sneakiness and controlling the battlefield, meaning they can dictate the tempo and flow of the battle to their advantage. Eshin Triads Only the most devout apprentice assassins ascend to the rank of Triad. Well-drilled and deadly, these warriors are a versatile alternative to their Clanrat and Stormvermin brethren and are best utilised behind the front ranks, excelling at exploiting gaps and weaknesses in the enemy lines. Whilst their armor isn’t the strongest, they make up for it with their Vanguard Deployment and Stalk abilities. Capabilities which enhance their sneakiness on the battlefield. Poisoned-Wind Mortar These mobile, rat-portable mortars are packed with a payload of poisoned wind-globes which can be fired at a much greater distance than their Globadier equivalents. Capable of causing the enemy damage over time as they choke on the deadly Warpstone gas, this unit excels at damaging a wide swathe of the enemy at once. Warp-Grinder Weapon Teams Drilling into the ground and their enemies alike, the Warp-Grinder Weapon Teams rely upon powerful active abilities that create devastating effects on the battlefield. Once they’ve tied down their enemies with tremor effects, their drills can pierce the toughest of armours… provided the team can get within range. This unit can also destroy settlement walls, rending stone asunder with scant regard for friend or foe. The Avalanche Mortar (Death Globe Mortars – Regiment of Renown) These rare and infernal devices can fire special air-burst globes from great distances that explode in mid-air and inflict devastating armor-piercing damage upon all units unfortunate enough to be caught in their line of fire. Viskrin’s Death Squad (Death Runner – Regiment of Renown) Viskrin’s Death Squad are the elite among their rank and excel at acts of espionage. Lightly armoured but highly mobile, this unit is capable of outputting great amounts of armour piercing damage with their trusty weeping blades as well as making use of their elite combat agility in order to become even harder for the enemy to hit in return. Ishka’s Triads (Eshin Triads – Regiment of Renown) Ishka’s Triads follow the teachings of Ishka Fastclaw, who was once the Nightlord of Clan Eshin. Exhibiting deadly anti-large capabilities, they have the ability to summon a decoy of themselves upon the battlefield, making them ideal for deceiving the enemy while both attacking and retreating.

{"name": "Total War: WARHAMMER II - The Warden & The Paunch", "release_date": "21 May, 2020", "final_price_number_original": 226000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 226000.0, "description": "About This Content The Warden & the Paunch is the latest Lords Pack for Total War: WARHAMMER II. Introducing two rival Legendary Lords from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, each with their own factions, objectives, mechanics, units and playstyle, for use in both the Eye of the Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns, and custom/multiplayer battles. Eltharion the Grim commands Yvresse (High Elves) while Grom the Paunch leads the Broken Axe Tribe (Greenskins). Neither Yvresse nor the Broken Axe tribe are involved in the Vortex race, but are pitted against one another as eternal nemeses, on a collision course to a final climactic encounter where only one can emerge the victor. Long has Eltharion the Warden of Tor Yvresse stood sentinel, ever-watchful for signs of Greenskin incursion. While he campaigned overseas against the Druchii of Naggarond in ages past, Tor Yvresse nearly fell as the green tsunami of Grom the Paunch’s legendary Waaagh! roared through Ulthuan. After defeating Grom and scattering his hordes, Eltharion swore that no Orc or Goblin filth would ever set foot in his lands again. But Grom has other designs. His cavernous belly aches for a rematch, and his hunger for vengeance is matched only by his titanic appetite. As his gobbos tend to the bubbling cauldron, delighting him with each tasty new morsel, his plans begin to set. He’ll gather them all, the bosses and the boys, wind them up to a fever pitch, and lead them on a Waaagh! the likes of which the world has never seen. This time, Tor Yvresse will fall, and its snooty Warden will kneel before the mighty Paunch! High Elves - Eltharion the Grim (Yvresse) Unique faction mechanics: Athel Tamarha In a secluded Yvresse mountainside lies Athel Tamarha, Eltharion’s base of operations. It lies in ruins, untouched since Grom’s previous Waaagh!, but Eltharion seeks to rebuild it in Tor Yvresse’s defence. In Eltharion's campaign, Athel Tamarha is represented by a new panel where the player rebuilds structures to gain numerous unique benefits. In addition, Eltharion can use his unique Warden’s Cage ability against enemy Heroes and Lords in battle. Should they fall while under its influence, they will be imprisoned in Athel Tamarha for interrogation… Athel Tamarha has a number of  structures across two unique chains which can be rebuilt. Each enhances Tor Yvresse’s defence rating and grants the following: The Silent Sentinels chain can increase Tor Yvresse’s defence rating and enable the recruitment and upgrading of elite Mistwalker units, plus increasing recruitment capacities for several unique elite unit types available to Eltharion. The Watchers of Yvresse chain enable the interrogation of captured Heroes and Lords, improvements to the Mist of Yvresse, and bonuses to Eltharion’s Influence. Through the questioning, vanquishing and indoctrination of captives, Eltharion can gain useful information and other benefits. Mist of Yvresse Tor Yvresse will become progressively shrouded by an enchanted mist, enhancing all of Eltharion's troops and disrupting enemies caught within it. Provides the unique Army Ability ‘Envelop in Mist’ which enhances your troops’ performance when fighting within its influence Athel Tamarha upgrades grant additional effects as the Mist become stronger. Increasing the strength of the Mist of Yvresse will eventually cause it to cover all of Ulthuan as a protective aid. Defence of Yvresse Eltharion will gradually build up defensive power at Tor Yvresse, as Eltharion's homeland becomes increasingly fortified against invasion. At the campaign outset, the city of Tor Yvresse will begin in a damaged state until upgrades are completed, progressing the city into rebuilt then fortified states. This is reflected in any battles fought over Tor Yvresse, affording increasingly stronger defensive abilities and options for Eltharion. The Yvresse defence level also expands the Mist of Yvresse to cover further regions of Ulthuan, enhancing Eltharion’s forces and weakening interlopers. Rite: Invocation of Ladrielle For Eltharion, the Invocation of Isha is replaced by the Invocation of Ladrielle, which empowers the Mists of Yvresse. New Units and Characters: Eltharion (Legendary Lord) Eltharion the Grim is the unflinching warden of Tor Yvresse. Atop his mighty Griffon, Stormwing, he swoops into battle with peerless conviction. Eltharion wields a spear and a sword, as well as being a caster of High Magic. This offers him the flexibility to alter his role in battle based on the circumstances at hand. His defence-focused abilities also make him excellent at holding firm battle lines. Archmage (Lord) The High Elven Archmages are amongst the greatest practitioners of Magic within the mortal realms. With the introduction of the Archmage, High Elf players now have access to all 8 core Winds of Magic and the Lore of High Magic to choose from, ideal for those who prefer a more magic-focused playstyle. Rangers High Elf Rangers are inhabitants of Ulthuan's more remote areas and are called upon in times of need. Silverin Guard Heavy Spear unit for High Elves. The Silverin Guard are tasked with defending the Watchstone of Tor Yvresse - a waystone of fabulous power. War Lions of Chrace These fearsome beasts are deadly hunting cats with a muscular frame and a sharp, cunning mind. Almost as tall at the shoulders as an Elven Steed, a War Lion is far stronger, able to break bones with each sweep of its claws and shatter even helmeted heads with a single chomp of its fanged maw. Lion Chariot of Chrace Many of the Phoenix King's bodyguard ride to battle in Lion Chariots. Each of these white-timbered constructions is drawn by a pair of snarling War Lions whose savage power is belied by their feline grace and elegantly plaited manes. Arcane Phoenix The Arcane Phoenix is a majestic and fearsome creature with a wingspan as great as any of the mighty War Eagles of the High Elves. Cloaked in blazing feathers that can turn the sharpest arrow, it is the living embodiment of the destructive and purging Wind of Aqshy. Campaign Exclusive Units: Eltharion's Mistwalkers The Skyhawks Swift and energetic, the Skyhawks never weary of battle, always standing ready to fight to the death if necessary. Sentinels of Astaril Former training partners to the Warden himself in his youth, the Sentinels are amongst his most trusted servicemen. Spire Guard of Tor Yvresse The honour guards of the Warden’s tower are Tor Yvresse’s foremost defenders, and the anchor around which its armies gather. Athel Tamarha Faithbearers Once of the household of Eltharion’s late father, the Faithbearers’ guilt over their master’s death drives them to fight to reclaim their valour. Knights of Tor Gaval Thanks to the challenges of training in their murky homeland, the Knights of Tor Gaval are rightly said to be amongst the most talented of wingmen in all Ulthuan. New Regiments of Renown Talons of Tor Caleda (Archers Light Armour) The Talons of Tor Caleda are an elite unit for Archers who serve the Prince of Caledor. Rahagra's Pride (War Lions of Chrace) Rahagra's Pride inherit their name from the fabled father of white lions. Omen of Asuryan (Arcane Phoenix) Arcane Phoenixes are the companions of Asuryan the Creator, harbingers of woe and bearers of hope in equal measure. They are drawn from Asuryan's side when the Winds of Magic howl through the world of mortals in mighty storms, and in distant mist-shrouded Ulthuan the High Elves are forewarned of the coming of these magical tempests by the sudden manifestation of Arcane Phoenixes in the skies above their island home. They are a mixed omen; a symbol of destruction soon to come as well as the hope of rebirth. Greenskins - Grom the Paunch (Broken Axe) Unique mechanics and features: Grom's Cauldron Grom has an insatiable appetite, as his girth attests to. In a Grom campaign, you’ll find a variety of ingredients around the world with which to cook up a range of recipes. By combining different ingredients in Grom's Cauldron, Grom and his boyz will be able to feast and gain special powers. Unlock a wide range of different ingredients from campaign exploration, and by meeting the Troll Hag Food Merchant. Combine ingredients to form dishes, each of which provides unique buffs to Grom and his army Some dishes can add special units to Grom's army Cooking up and sampling a certain number of dishes will permanently enhance Grom himself. Blacktoof During Grom’s legendary Waaagh!, his most trusted Shaman, Ol’ Blacktoof, nearly brought destruction to Ulthuan and beyond by felling the Elven Waystones and drawing their power into himself. Fate intervened in the form of Eltharion, who separated Blacktoof’s head neatly from his shoulders. But the shaman’s surging power helped him to cheat true death, and his disembodied head serves his master still. While Niblet is Grom’s chief advisor, Blacktoof will from time to time utter guidance to Grom, delivering tasks and moulding the journey to his inevitable and decisive showdown with Eltharion. Blacktoof’s head will also take on the role of a special item in Grom's campaign. He may be assigned to a Shaman, granting the ability to summon a Rogue Idol in battle. New Units and Characters: Grom the Paunch (Legendary Lord) Grom is the self-styled king of the goblins. He wields the mighty Axe of Grom, and rides into battle atop the sturdy Chariot of Grom, with his trusty Night Goblin Assistant and standard bearer, Niblet. The presence of Grom near friendly troops inspires them with a leadership buff. If Grom makes his way into the fighting, that buff increases. Grom is ALWAYS mounted atop the Chariot of Grom. Giant River Hag Troll (Hero) Giant River Troll Hags are hateful and bitter creatures, far larger and more dangerous than their common kin. These Lore of Death casters are invested with an innate ability to shape the Winds of Magic as they stir the brackish waters in which they dwell. Snotling Pump Wagons The Snotling Pump Wagon is a wooden fighting platform on wheels. Like a chariot, a Pump Wagon hurtles towards the foe to run them over. However, the Pump Wagon rumbles under its own power, with momentum provided by Snotlings, who frantically pump crude contraptions and cranks to drive the belts that turn the wheels. Snotling Pump Wagons (Flappas) Flappas are crude wings, attached to the side of the Pump Wagon, and flapped up and down by the actions of the crew. This allows the Pump Wagon to make short jumps as it bounces along. Snotling Pump Wagons (Spiky Rollers) These Pump Wagons are fitted with a roller studded with sharp spikes. River Trolls A River Troll somewhat resembles a riverbed: coated in sediment, slime, rotting vegetation, fish carcasses, and various other stinky detritus whose precise nature and origin are too horrible to contemplate. In all probability the River Troll’s stink is even worse than that of the riverbed, since one can add the Troll’s personal miasma to the ill-omened mélange of odours emitted from the mucky smears on its skin. Stone Trolls Stone Trolls are a distinct breed of Troll which live exclusively in caves and the mountainous regions of the world. Since they live on rocky mountains, they tend to consume large quantities of stone, the natural magical inertia of which imbues them with a certain degree of magical resistance. Rogue Idol Rogue Idols are mighty magical constructs with the ability to crush armoured knights, batter city walls and just about anything else that gets in their way with their brutal fists. New Regiments of Renown Logey Bogey's Spore 'Sploda's (Snotling Pump Wagon) The most unhinged Snotlings attach really big explodin' spores to the front of their Wagons, which burst when the Pump Wagon hits anything. Da Swamp Fings (River Trolls) Da Swamp 'Fings are a horrifying band of River Trolls which cause Terror and have Poison Attacks. Da Big 'Un (Rogue Idol) Da Big 'Un is the biggest, baddest, meanest, most cunning Rogue Idol ever conjured.

The Firepower pack brings 10 new units to the battlefields of Gladius Prime! The new units will bring overwhelming firepower and will increase the strategic options available to all commanders. Rogal Dorn Battle Tank - Astra Militarum Heavily armoured battle tank fitted with powerful weapons The Rogal Dorn Battle Tank is a lumbering behemoth, equally suited to anchoring a battle line, or grinding forward in support of an assault. Bristling with thunderous guns, these hulking armoured fighting vehicles pound breaches in enemy’s defences with enormous shells, and tear apart infantry with raucous storms of fire. Whirlwind - Space Marines Artillery tank with a variety of missiles to pound enemy positions from afar The Whirlwind is the Adeptus Astartes’ foremost artillery tank. Highly mobile despite its fire support role, it excels in the annihilation of massed infantry and light armour. Able to keep pace with the swift advance of a Space Marine strike force, squadrons of Whirlwinds lurk behind or amongst their comrades’ formations, always ready to unleash a thundering barrage of missiles upon the foe at extreme range. When working in concert with farranging Land Speeders ‘spotters’, Whirlwind artillery tanks are utterly lethal, even to garrisons of enemy fortifications and troops occupying concealed positions. Deathmark - Necrons Sniper unit that teleports to reach its target Crackling into reality in the middle of battle to annihilate their enemies, Deathmarks are the assassins of the Necron cohorts. These specialist killers are possessed of a patience known only to the undying, and once a Deathmark has marked its prey, nothing will stand between it and its target. Unerringly accurate and single-minded in their devotion to the kill, they are often employed to locate and destroy enemy commanders, or hunt down priority targets in order to disrupt their foe’s strategy. Though some phaerons consider the use of the Deathmarks to contravene the ancient Necrontyr codes of honour, none can dispute their effectiveness when given a target. Deff Dread - Orks Heavy assault walker unit that excels in close combat. Deff Dreads are clanking monstrosities that behave in battle much like enormous metal Orks. They clank toward the foe, waving piston-driven arms that end in saws, claws and really big guns. Lurching along as fast as their hydraulic legs will carry them, their bellows of ‘Waaagh!’ echo from in-built speakers at earsplitting volume. Though all this is hugely entertaining for Orks fighting alongside a Deff Dread, for enemies it is utterly terrifying. Deff Dreads epitomise the unstoppable ferocity of the Orks, and the damage they can do is jaw-dropping. The brutal implantation surgery and subsequent claustrophobia tends to drive Deff Dread pilots a bit bonkers. They will take any opportunity to vent their frustrations violently upon the foe, if only to make themselves feel better about having to eat everything through a straw… Greater Brass Scorpion - Chaos Space Marines Super-heavy walker vehicle that can devastate any enemy frontline with its powerful weapons. A towering monster of armour plating and hellish metal flesh, powered by burning souls and bearing an arsenal of murderous weapons, a brass scorpion is an animate altar to Khorne, Chaos god of bloodshed and battle. They are devastating, half-crazed entities, more rampaging beast than war machine, and they take evident delight in the slaughter of the enemy, tossing aside wrecked vehicles in their path and skewering the bodies of the slain beneath their hydraulic claws. They are especially feared for the evident predilection with which they use their huge claws to wrinkle enemy troops out of cover, plucking screaming victims from trenches and bastions before tearing them apart in a welter of blood. XV107 R’Varna Battlesuit - T’au Heavily armoured monstrous creature equipped with extremely powerful long-range weaponry and a multipurpose nova reactor. A development of the Riptide, the T'au XV107 R'varna battlesuit sacrifices mobility for heavier armour and increased firepower in the form of two pulse submunition cannon, experimental weapons systems which fire micro-cluster projectiles capable of saturating the target area in a deadly storm of plasma pulses. Dark Reaper - Craftworld Aeldari Long-range anti-armour infantry equipped with a variety of missiles to deal against fast targets. From far across the battlefield, the Dark Reapers cut down their enemies with devastating salvoes of missiles, each armour-piercing projectile ripping through the air to blast ragged holes in tanks and soldiers alike. Silhouetted against the sky from their position on the high ground, the Reapers are as Khaine himself calling down destruction upon the unworthy. Impassive and all-seeing, they scan the horizon for any signs of movement, complex relays allowing their gaze to be channelled through the barrels of their ritual weaponry at will. Then, with unflinching precision, the Reapers wreak devastation upon their chosen targets. Kataphron Breacher - Adeptus Mechanicus Canticles of the Omnissiah infantry unit with powerful anti-vehicle armament. Kataphron Breachers are battle servitors many times the size and power of those used by the rest of the Imperium. Utterly deadly at close quarters, they are not born so much as constructed, their every enhancement geared for maximum lethality. They are easily recognised by their growling motive units, vicious hydraulic pincers and deadly shoulder-mounted cannons. Yet the most vital component of all is within – the soul of a violent man. In battle Kataphron Breachers rumble forward at the command of their Tech-Priest masters, fulfilling the role of living shield and battering ram alike. Originally devised to break apart enemy battle lines and fortifications, they are of great use to those adepts who wish to seize a valuable artefact from the clutches of would-be usurpers. Imagifier - Adepta Sororitas Support infantry unit that buffs nearby Adepta Sororitas infantry units It is the most sacred role of the Imagifier to extol the virtues of fallen Sisters and preach tales of their saintly deeds. Imagifiers bear aloft great stanchions in the image of a martyr inscribed with holy texts, and go wherever the fighting is thickest to recite litanies and inspire their fellow Sisters. Poxwalker - Neutral Light melee infantry unit able to regenerate in combat. Poxwalkers are victims of the Walking Pox, a cruel virulence that rots the infected to death whilst keeping them conscious. They are terror troops, their ceaseless groaning the vector by which they infect the living. In battle they drown their foes in a sea of decaying flesh, clawing hands and gnashing teeth. Please note: Tyranids have received a new unit for free with the accompanying patch. Tyrannocyte, a monstrous creature that transports units to the frontline and supports them by pinning down enemy units. The unit had to be free so that it can come with the Brood Haunt building—otherwise there would be no buildable units when you construct the building. This was done to provide the best and most balanced experience—we believe the unit has to come early enough, before Carnifex, to be maximally useful. It would have been easier to let it be unlocked at a later tier, but we felt that was not right for the game.", "review_summary": "Positive", "developer": "Proxy Studios", "publisher": "Proxy Studios", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 4 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or equivalent"},

Their peaceful lives, working in the mining industry, have been disturbed by a threat that they cannot face alone: the Arachnids. Under Colonel Hawthorne’s command, the Mobile Infantry will take back control of the planet and smash everything that has more than two legs.

The Arachnids may have virtually limitless numbers, but they lack the thorough tactical training that the Mobile Infantry enjoys. Position your units in advantageous choke points or on higher elevations. Be wary, however, that battle mechanics such as True Line of Sight and True Line of Fire may limit your field of fire and allow the treacherous Bugs to lay in ambush. Optimize your army by choosing from a wide range of specialized unit types, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and set of unlockable elite abilities. Rifle Troopers can use their shotgun ability to hold back large numbers of Arachnids, M11 Marauders bipeds can unleash a withering mortar barrage and the Fleet Liaison can call down dropships with reinforcements or direct an airstrike to wipe out whole swaths of enemies. The Bug infestation is rooted in elaborate underground hives. These present a unique challenge that demands a delicate balance between aggression and defense.

Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Tyranids introduces a new playable race, which joins the fight for Gladius Prime! Thanks to their numerous new gameplay mechanics and features, they are a radically different faction, unlike any other in the game. The distinctive traits of the Tyranids are represented in the way they play. They are a ravenous, hungry swarm. They will consume Gladius Prime! The Tyranid race travels the stars, systematically consuming anything that enables its rapid evolution and reproduction... so it may consume even more. On Gladius, the Tyranid faction specialises in reclaiming biomass from enemies, its own units and even by stripping tiles back down to the bedrock. To the Tyranids, to stay still is to die. They consume and they move on. When an organism has served its purpose, from the smallest Ripper to the mightiest Tyrant, they walk willingly into the reclamation pool, so their biomass may be re-used. The Hive Mind is the gestalt consciousness of the Tyranid race, controlling its creations through a pervasive psychic shadow generated by alpha creatures like Hive Tyrants and Warriors. But should its troops fall outside of this control, they become wild beasts, running feral, attacking Tyranid and enemy alike. Tyranid units are monstrosities, adapted by the controlling Norn Queens by devouring the DNA of their enemies.

Then the demons came—pouring out from the land below, overrunning the holy land and defeating the goddess through violent war—bringing about an age of darkness. The humans who once lived peacefully under the goddess' protection are now ruled over by the four demon queens, known as the Dark Lords. Any humans deemed worthless have their souls farmed to create Tactica, a crystalline object used as a material for weapons and as fuel. However, a new conflict arises as rumors of Empress Karvia's plans to take over all of Helvetia spread, causing the other three Dark Lords to simultaneously declare war on the Empire. Despite being surrounded on all sides, Empress Karvia remains confident that she will prevail. After all, she has a secret task force under her command, one that served her well in the war against the goddess: The “Black Arme Vapula,” led by the war hero Leonhardt Arknoah. Gameplay Features Battalion Battles (Triple Squad Battles) In this new instalment of the Venusblood series, we present you with the new \"Battalion Battle\" system!

Create teams, deploy them, and watch as your custom-crafted teams destroy the enemy! Squad Positioning on the Map In VenusBlood HOLLOW, you can place your units on important chokepoints to play defensively, or you can go all-out and send multiple squads to the enemy base and capture it by force!

Raise them, assign them to a squad, give them equipment, and bring them with you into battle! You can also assign titles to soldiers that you hire, which will allow the unit to learn skills that they would not have learned otherwise.

Internal Administration Internal administration is an important part of waging war as well! Your internal administration parameters influence your generation of food, magic, Anima (required to recruit units) and gold, as well as the effectiveness of your military and medicine. Logistics are important in a war, too! Awakening System You can choose to \"awaken\" a captured Dark Lord to make them loyal to you and your cause. Once a Dark Lord is fully awakened, both their outward appearance and personality will change. Will you leave the captured Dark Lords the way they are? Or will you break their will to awaken their new potential? Multiple Endings Depending on the decisions you make throughout the game, how the story progresses will change. Do you seek chaos and evil, or justice and nobility? Choose wisely, for they will influence the ending you get. Both the Law and Chaos routes have unique endings, as well as sub-endings! Will you agree with Sylvia’s method and seek a more peaceful means of revolutionizing the Empire? Or will you give in to your desires and take a darker path of destruction to fulfill your ambitions...

Players could create either free play or challenge play, all the parameters could be set based on players minds as well. In the game, players roll the dice and it determines the steps they could move on the map, earning money by investment on properties, buying stocks or using cards, when the game ends, the only player who are not broke or owns the most in finance wins the play. Free Play This is the classic mode in the series, all the players have the same initial cash, deposit and cards at the beginning, and all these could be set freely, players even can set, the price increase days, play time, player number, group play, etc as much as they wish. Challenge Play This is a new play mode. Players are facing the challenges from the landlords. There are 3 difficulties: easy, normal and hard to choose for each landlord. Players need to win them in different levels in the circumstance with short of talents, initial cash and properties to get their special achievements. Classic Maps The franchise was known to the public in 1989, classic maps take the torch from its predecessors, using tiles to link small and large properties, banks, lotto's, shops, news and magic house. Investing small properties is the main way to gain the profits. Other than this, players needs to keep and eye on other players and NPCs like gods’ movements. Using large properties, cards, banks and magic house to increase their income and face the emergent affairs or sabotage opponent’s plans. Brawl Maps It starts in Richman 10, in this mode, small property tiles is replaced by mines, missiles and bombs, using attack cards could bring damage to opponents’ finance and that is the core to win the play. In this franchise, brawl maps have different routes from classic maps. Maps on brawl mode are more complicated, why not using missiles to attack the opponents on the road, or place the mines at the corners. Property Investing Buy empty land, build houses or chain stores on it, receive rentals from players who pass by. Buy properties as many as possible, and level up the buildings hard for large amount of rentals. When in group play, the properties could be leveled up by teammates. Stock Buying In the play, players could adjust the proportion of cash and deposit when passing by banks. Cash is the key to invest properties and card purchase, deposit could bring a considerable interest from banks monthly. In offline mode, deposit could be used to buy stocks, be smart and earn some extra financial income. Card Cards are the original content in this series, and it is the most strategic system in game, also the unique feature different from other monopoly genre games. Players could buy limited cards in shops by cash. There are different kinds of cards, some of them could level up the buildings, some could control others movements and summon gods. In this franchise, we add some new features, hope players would enjoy them. Tip 1: Don’t miss the guy who wears white suit and a masque. Tip 2: A penny saved is a penny eared. Mechanics After this series develops 30 years or so, we add a brand new feature - mechanics. It is a special tile in the maps, having different effects in different maps, when it’s on, it could probably change the direction of the road, may turn on or off the banks and shops and even mess up the location of mines and bombs.

You will build the airport’s infrastructure with everything from runways and taxiways, gates and aprons to constructing terminals with check-in, security, restaurants and shops. You will manage the business perspective of the airport by hiring employees and executives, making deals with airline companies and making sure that ends meet by keeping an eye on budget and resources. You will have to cater to the passengers by keeping waiting time to a minimum, by having friendly and helpful staff around and by making passengers feel secure, keeping any potential incidents at bay; a happy passenger is a spending passenger. Hopefully you won’t run into any problems such as stressed out employee, equipment breakdowns or bad weather which can cause massive delays or even emergency landings. You will be held accountable when things go wrong and filthy rich when things go right. Running an airport Your objective is to build and manage your airport to perfection by making strategic decisions, designing the optimal airport layout and ultimately making sure that your passengers and airlines are satisfied. You will need to build the entire airport from scratch including terminal foundations with floors, walls, doors and items as well as the airport infrastructure including runways, taxiways, aprons and other airport infrastructure. Everything in Airport CEO is deeply simulated and it is your job to make sure it all runs smoothly and with a positive bank account. Airlines Airlines and their travelers are an essential element of Airport CEO as they consist of the main source of your airport’s income. Signing contracts with airlines bring cash-flow and passengers to your airport which in term means opportunities for receiving different service fees, as well as passenger expenditures. Airlines come in different sizes and have different requirements on your airport and the services you offer, you are responsible for not only planning the flight schedule but also for meeting and maintaining the needs. Occasionally you will need to handle emergencies and delays due to bad weather or accidents in the area, all which will put your management skills to the test. Passengers Passengers in Airport CEO all have their unique personalities, needs, a background story and most importantly; a flight to catch (on time). Passengers are thoroughly simulated and their decisions, behaviors and opinions about your airport are affected by several factors. Passengers in Airport CEO, just as in real life, must wait in lines, check in, pass security and then entertain themselves until their flight is ready for boarding. Arriving passengers must find their way the baggage claim, get a hold of their bags and maybe pass a customs booth before getting on their airport transfer. Whether they’ll be able to actually catch their flight is up to you: Passengers might have a hard time finding their way around the airport so you build an information desk, passengers might get irritated because of the long security queue and waiting time so you extend its capacity, passengers might complain about the lack of fun things to do in the gate area so you build a duty-free shop or exclusive brand boutiques. Employees Employees are those you rely on to keep your airport running. Just as passengers they are simulated individuals who have a mind of their own. Employees have a number of different roles and it is your job to make sure that your airport has the right and necessary work force at any time. From passenger service agents, janitors, ramp agents and mechanics, security officers to administrators and executives. The more you expand your airport’s capacity and services, the more versatile and skilled your employees have to be. When employees interact with passengers, they’ll have to be skilled at managing people and stress resistant in order to avoid making mistakes or give bad customer service. Facilities and buildings Airports are complex mega-structures with a lot of different buildings and facilities. While a small airport might not need more than a simple grass runway and a terminal, as you grow your airport you will have to expand its facilities ranging from air control towers, larger aircraft stands and taxiways to fire, weather, catering or fuel stations. As your airport grows your terminal grows with it and you will have to make sure that it is equipped with the necessary facilities that passengers are expecting. Building a terminal in Airport CEO is highly customizable where you lay out its shape and interior such floor type, walls, windows and doors. Baggage needs to be processed and transported to the same flight as its owner and its all up to you to avoid bottlenecks and by designing the ultimate airport terminal. Being a CEO Data, data, data! As the acting CEO of your airport you need to be able to make difficult business decisions based on current operation. In Airport CEO you’re provided with multiple sources of information from which you can draw conclusions and manage your airport. As the CEO you will not only be responsible for the architecture of the airport but also for those working in it. Tired of planning every flight? Establish an informatics department and let an automated system do it for you! Tired of assessing the monthly budget balance? Hire a CFO which can help you cut cost and set prices.

The most luxurious bar that ladies and gentlemen come and gather. The beautiful maids who worked there danced and talked with the customers to amuse them. One day, the protagonist was told to meet his uncle. His uncle told him he had newly opened a future-next generation Empire Club which was customizable and filled with new possibilities. Unexpectedly, his uncle generously handed over the ownership of Empire Club… However, Empire Club was secretly in huge debt. Although he cursed his uncle for fleeing outside of the country neglecting Empire Club as it was, he had no choice but to run the place. Not only he had to save the club from debt, there were so many outrageous problems. It was obvious that it wouldn’t be easy to solve everything. In front of the protagonist who was totally at a loss, three maids appeared. They were the last few maids who remained working at Empire Club. “Maria Seido” who is innocent and cheerful. “Mafuyu Himuro” with serious and loyal personality. “Risa Takizawa” a dignified, mature woman. Starting with these three, the protagonist and maids cooperate to rebuild the future-next generation Empire club. ■Character Edits The most crucial feature of this product- Editing characters.

Each of the new units brings something new to their faction: support abilities, superior firepower, devastating psyker powers, and more. Astra Militarum - Ratlings Sniper infantry unit that can move after shooting. Though less resilient than their human comrades, Ratlings are naturally excellent shots. It is said that Ratling marksmen can take the head off a heretic from over a kilometre away. Coupled with their knack for staying out of harm’s way, this makes Ratlings formidable snipers who can take a surprising toll upon superior enemy forces. Chaos Space Marines - Dark Disciples Infantry unit that increases the defenses of Chaos units. Dark Disciples carry profane accoutrements of their masters’ worship and parrot the fell words spoken in his baleful prayers. Many such disciples have been augmented to better serve in their role–their skin stretched out and inked with grim litanies, or their mouths fitted with Daemon-touched vox-grilles to project their voices into the warp. Amidst the din of combat they join their Dark Apostle’s chants, crying out for the Chaos Gods to manifest their blessings. Craftworld Aeldari - Warlock Psyker infantry unit that can teleport around the battlefield and cleanse their foes. When the Warlocks of the craftworlds join their minds, the fate of worlds can hinge upon their actions. As true sons of Khaine, these militant psykers will plunge into combat at the slightest provocation. Witchblades and singing spears are swung in graceful arcs, leaving coruscating webs of energy behind them as the Conclave carves through the ranks of their adversaries. They do so with joy in their souls, for of all the seers of the Eldar hosts, the Warlocks are the fiercest and most violent of all. Necrons - Canoptek Wraiths Extremely mobile infantry unit that passes through terrain and enemies with equal ease. Canoptek Wraiths flit across the battlefield like the spectres of the restless dead. Using their dimensional destabilisation matrices, these strange constructs are able to phase in and out of reality at will. This unique technology means that, though no more than mindless drones, Canoptek Wraiths have manifold uses in war. Fortifications are no obstacle to a Wraith, and they are able to pass more or less undetected even through the midst of the foe, making them exceptional spies and assassins both. Furthermore, Canoptek Wraiths make effective terror- troops, appearing as if from nowhere to strike at vital targets in the enemy’s midst. Here, swirling through the panicked gunfire of the foe, the Wraiths flicker rapidly in and out of phase with reality, shots and blades passing harmlessly through their indistinct forms. Orks - Kill Bursta Super-heavy vehicle with a big kannon and transport assault capacity. Kill tanks are an Ork heavy tank design based around the twin Ork loves of speed and extreme violence. The Kill Bursta's main gun is an immense, wide-bore siege mortar mounted in the centre of its forward hull, much in the manner of a Space Marine Vindicator, only much, much larger! The huge rocket-boosted ordnance launched by the bursta gun, while appallingly short ranged, is powerful enough to blast a hardened bunker or defensive bastion to smithereens, and has been observed in direct fire shattering Imperial super-heavy tanks in a single shot, based as much on luck as good judgement by its gunners. Space Marines - Devastator Centurion Very bulky infantry unit with massive armaments. Devastator Centurions pound their enemies with a remorseless, relentless rain of fire. Bloody havoc is wrought upon anything that falls within the Centurions’ targeting reticules. The pilots’ marksmanship is augmented by the grim machine spirits of their warsuits, decimator protocols guiding servo-assisted recoil absorption and oracular auto-targeting to ensure the Centurions maintain a punishing rate of fire. Return fire is a futile gesture, akin to flinging stones at a fortress, for should the enemy launch an assault in an attempt to silence the Devastator Centurions’ guns they must contend with the suits’ massive strength and the pilots’ skill at arms. T'au - Krootox Rider Sneaky infantry unit with both ranged and close combat capabilities. Surging from the undergrowth with their rifles blazing, the warriors of the Kroot Carnivore squads fall upon their victims with feral shrieks. In their midst lumber massive Krootoxes, gunners perched upon their backs as they direct sawing bursts of heavy fire into the foe. Tyranids - Venomthrope Infantry unit with poisonous attacks and a protective spore cloud. The Venomthrope serves as a living chemical weapon dispenser for the swarms of the Tyranid hive fleets. Its whip-like tentacles drip with a multitude of alien poisons. Indeed, so potent are these toxins that it is believed that a Venomthrope's very touch means certain death.", "review_summary": "Positive", "developer": "Proxy Studios", "publisher": "Proxy Studios", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 1 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or equivalent"},

Immerse yourself in a dark, desperate world full of foes, lost souls, and hidden secrets. A World Shrouded in Darkness Long ago, the Great Beast arose from the sea and covered the earth in poison fog. Choking out the land of both life and light, a new era of wondrous misery began. Centuries have passed. The once hallowed halls and bustling streets are mere shadows. Those deemed undesirable are thrown into the Great Well, a pit of chaos and disease. Cast into its depths for crimes unknown, you awaken in this moonlit subterranean world. Your only hope lies with the sleeping Old One deep below. But many perils lie between you and your ultimate goal. An Era Lost to Time From the mind of horror master Akuma Kira, Lunacid harkens to a lost era of first-person ARPGs. Legendary for their meticulous design and dense dungeons, the King’s Field series was the Dark Souls before there was a Dark Souls. Long abandoned by AA/AAA developers, the mantle of “King’s-Like” is left to the humble indie. Which is great, because that's where all the cool weird stuff comes from anyways. The world of Lunacid is bursting at the seams with new things to discover, from hidden magics to secret areas. This isn’t just the odd room with a chest in it; entire new areas await those with a watchful eye. Esoteric puzzles and cryptic hints galore are sure to confound and delight even the experienced dungeon delver. Tactile Combat Take yourself back to a time before dodge rolling. Swipe, backstep, block, and overcome foes with patience and persistence. Featuring a robust body targeting system and unique elemental weaknesses/resistances, each encounter becomes a skilful yet deadly dance of death. Begin your journey as a thief, knight, cleric, or… vampire? Building your character up to you. An Arsenal to Uncover Over 75 weapons await you in the fetid halls of Lunacid. 37 Unique spells, each with applications beyond the obvious. Finding them all, however, is another matter. Unless you use a guide. Which hey, we won’t judge.┐(￣ヮ￣)┌ Classic RPG Challenge Don’t forget to save. Featuring dozens of hours of gameplay and multiple endings, Lunacid is a rich and rewarding take on a classic formula. Relics of past game design long abandoned lie in wait. So jump in the Great Well and let the wonders of Lunacid surprise you. Mimics might just steal your silver instead of eat you.

Weed Shop 3 is a recreational marijuana dispensary simulator with business management mechanics, FPS action, and a crazy storyline you'd come to expect from the guys who most definitely didn't smoke crack with Kevin from Tenderloin. You start your Marijuana-infused adventure just like the last time: broke and clueless. How broke? Grow your weed in the toilet, look for singles in the trash, smoke roaches, deal ditch weed to burnouts type of broke. The journey to the top will be long and grindy, but hey, at least you still have your kidneys and a little bit of weed, so start growing and work your way up the Ganja ladder! Deal weed on the streets or sell it in your shop and use the proceeds to expand your operation. Upgrade your grow setup and grow larger quantities of more potent strains. Improve the visual appearance of the shop to attract higher-paying clientele. Make and sell your own pre-rolls as well as various paraphernalia. Once your grow op becomes too much for one stoner to handle, get more! Hire staff and have them specialize in selective fields such as farming, promoting, sales, etc. as they gain more experience. Having experienced staff will allow you to outsource most of the daily grind so you can focus on bigger things. Now since you got some free time on your hands and, hopefully, a whole lot of cash in the safe, why not open up a second facility and start experimenting with cross-breeding new strains? Breeding a new more potent hybrid strain will take a lot of trial and error unless you get to know the right people, that is. Got them hybrids growing in your brand new field already? Perfect! All you need now is some hash extractors, heated dab presses, and cart fillers and you'll be producing solventless concentrates with the highest THC in town, Congrats you've finally almost made it... sort of. All you need is some brand recognition and, fortunately for you, Sunless Beach is crawling with various influencers. Hire them to promote your products, gain their respect, and turn them into high-paying customers who will then promote your shop for free. Almost making it comes at a cost though. As news of your Weed Shop spreads across the city, you will come under the radar of a local cartel.  If you manage to gain their respect, you'll be able to run gang-related tasks and sell them your product in bulk. The road to becoming the biggest Weed Dealer on the coast won't be without its challenges. You'll have to deal with shoplifters, crackheads, snitches, thugs, and some other **** we can't disclose for legal reasons. However, whenever the going gets tough just grab a blunt and light up! Hit the beach, your pad, or the club and dab out until you trip out!", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Weed Games", "publisher": "Weed Games", "game_tag": "Immersive Sim", "minimum_ram": " 10 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 12 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Core i7-6700 or Ryzen 5 1600"},

Every design detail of your warships has a significant effect on the combat capability of your ships. STRONG AI Naval combat becomes immersive and feels even more realistic when your opponent is able to react to your actions with a human-like and unexpected behavior. The AI evaluates the optimal engagement distance, using principles of the “Immunity Zone” and comparing its own firepower versus your ships. The AI uses ammunition wisely, holding fire when necessary or switching shell types according to the armor protection of the target. Unless there is a special mission directive, the AI will not act suicidally and will attempt to withdraw, if its fleet becomes heavily damaged or it is much weaker than yours.

And their boats, and their jet skis… With the Tidal Wave DLC you can set up a new gas station on a remote paradise island that is governed by its own unique rules, offers new game mechanics, stunning surroundings and god appeasement. A new surrounding needs new dangers and events. Tides, waves and thunderstorms are among those that might disrupt your day. While you won’t need Ruddy to clean up sand after a dust storm, the new weather phenomena come with their own mechanics and there will still be some clean up to be done. That’s the price you pay for being in on a lush, tropical island… The happiness or anger of the god, Chunchumanchu, is indicated by a Volcano meter. His anger builds over time and can be hastened by customer dissatisfaction. Keep Chunchumanchu happy by throwing coconuts or other items into a cauldron at a sacred altar. Different actions have varying impacts on reducing the god's anger. Failure to keep the god happy results in an ominous eruption that temporarily transforms the paradise into a hellish landscape, disrupting business and scaring customers away. With a whole new surrounding come new expectations. Sure, there are still customers who want their cars to be fuelled and repaired, but there is also a whole new slew of customers with expectations that are in-line with the new environment. Their jet skis and boats need fuel and the tourists expect to be entertained. How about offering them scuba diving equipment or surfing rentals? You have to take care of everything better than ever. The right equipment and maintenance becomes crucial, it’s not just about satisfaction anymore. Poor equipment can lead to accidents and accidents increase Chunchumanchu's anger.

{"name": "Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Escalation Pack", "release_date": "1 Jun, 2022", "final_price_number_original": 102000.0, "final_price_number_discount": 76500.0, "description": "About This Content New unit types for all factions enter the fray with the Escalation Pack. Each of the new units brings something new to their faction, from exceptional abilities to overwhelming firepower. Chaos Space Marines - Forgefiend Fast walker unit with twin rotary guns. The Forgefiend Daemon Engine was originally devised to sow death amongst enemy forces from afar. Roughly centauroid in form, the torso of the Forgefiend boasts twin weapon-mounts that carry hell-forged parodies of Imperial armaments. The most common Forgefiends are created with pairs of hades autocannons in place of their primary limbs, rotary gun-clusters that allow them to scythe down masses of enemy troops and even lightly armoured vehicles with contemptuous ease. Tyranids - Hive Guards Ranged tough infantry unit. Hive Guard are heavily armoured gun-beasts bound to extremely powerful symbiotic bio-weapons. Though they have no eyes, Hive Guard possess a weak telepathic ability that allows them to perceive through the senses of other Tyranids, giving them access to a wealth of targeting information that would overwhelm even the most sophisticated technological cogitator. The scant mental capacity apportioned to the Hive Guard means that, without the direction of the Hive Mind, they have been known to stand motionless, waiting for prey to come within range instead of moving forwards to engage. Adeptus Mechanicus - Skitarii Rangers Doctrina Imperatives infantry unit with a sniper weapon and move through cover. Where the Tech-Priests are hunters of knowledge, their Skitarii Rangers are hunters of sentient creatures – the enemies of the Omnissiah in particular. These unstoppable cyborgs do not rest until the bloody deed is done, for they are driven ever onward by the imperative to locate their foes and ensure their destruction. They do this not in Drop Pod strikes launched from above, nor by sudden teleportation into the midst of the enemy, but by stalking their quarry over the course of weeks or even months until it can run no more. Once the designated target is in their crosshairs the air fills with the thump and crackle of galvanic weaponry, even as the Skitarii continue their relentless advance. The stink of electrocuted corpses is never far behind. Space Marines – Scouts Infantry unit specializing in reconnaissance and infiltration. The first the enemy knows of a Scout Squad’s presence is when its advance is brought to a sudden, violent halt. Heads snap back and warriors crumple to the floor, neat holes drilled through their skulls by sniper fire. The sudden boom of shotguns sees foes thrown from their feet with bloody craters blasted in their chests and backs. Bolt pistols bark, counterpointed by the thump of heavy bolter fire and the screams of the dying as enemies caught in the crossfire are torn apart by mass-reactive shells. Even artillery and heavy weapons troopers are not safe, as ambushing Scouts burst from concealment to wreak havoc on the enemy’s rear lines. However a Scout Squad chooses to attack its foes, it will be with total surprise and from an unexpected quarter, their stealth and cunning proving to be just as deadly as bolter and blade. Astra Militarum – Devil Dog Fast tank unit with a deadly armour-melting cannon. Acquiring its name from the high-pitched howl this weapon makes upon firing, the Devil Dog is capable of punching far above its weight in armoured combat. Indeed, many Devil Dog crews style themselves as big game hunters or monster slayers, excelling in the eradication of enemy armour and exceptionally heavy infantry assets. A foe forced to fight protracted campaigns in dense terrain against the Imperial Guard soon learns to dread the hunched silhouette of the Devil Dog – those who don’t soon find their vehicles reduced to molten slag by this aggressive and fast moving tank hunter. Necrons – Ghost Ark Transport vehicle with healing abilities. Ghost Arks are tasked with trawling for remnants of Necrons unable to self-repair. Recovered components are set upon by swarms of constructor scarabs that return the fallen Necrons to full function. Repaired warriors are then locked in stasis until the Ghost Ark is at capacity, at which point it will either return its cargo to their tomb world or else deploy them directly into battle. Ghost Arks are often used as conventional transports that ferry reinforcements into battle – however, they truly come into their own once their grim cargo has disembarked. Drifting behind the ranks of Necrons, the Arks flicker with emerald energies as they repair one fallen foot soldier after another. The enemy can only watch with dawning horror as their best efforts to slay the Necrons are undone. Craftworld Aeldari – Hornets Fast reconnaissance skimmer unit. The Hornet is a small, single-seater attack craft deployed by Aeldari armoured forces in a fast reconnaissance and raiding role. It can be found at the forefront of Aeldari armoured attacks, speeding ahead of the main force of Wave Serpents, often operating alongside other high-speed attack craft such as Jetbikes and Vypers. Even by the Aeldari race's high standards, the Hornet's engine is a wonder of its kind. Orks - Megatrakk Scrapjets A metal tube covered in things that make enemies die. A favourite amongst Speed Freeks and grounded Flyboyz alike, Megatrakk Scrapjets provide rocket-propelled acceleration, impressive firepower and the hilarity of ramming into enemy lines at the helm of what is effectively a gigantic, thrust-driven drill. These vehicles allow former Ork pilots to revel in the dimly-remembered joy of mowing down enemies at point-blank range – a joy which, of course, often caused the Flyboy to crash in the first place. Explosions blossom amidst the enemy as rokkits and missiles collide with their targets, while Grot tail-gunners blaze away with chattering big shootas – the array of weaponry welded, bolted, riveted and lashed onto a Megatrakk Scrapjet is fearsome. T'au – Tiger Shark Flying super-heavy fighter-bomber unit equipped with maximum firepower. The Tiger Shark is a large aircraft deployed in a fighter bomber role. Often encountered flying in support of T'au Hunter cadres during major operations, the Tiger Shark's main role appears to be the deployment of drones although, more recently, those armed with multiple seeker missiles have also been encountered. Efforts by the Adeptus Mechanicus to recover damaged Tiger Shark craft from battlefields have been met by fierce resistance by T'au Empire forces, as well as by certain elements of the Inquisition.", "review_summary": "Positive", "developer": "Proxy Studios", "publisher": "Proxy Studios", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 1 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or equivalent"},

The unique simulator that allows you to ride countless types of vehicles, from quads to tree-wheelers, MX sidecars to dirtbikes, superbikes to pitbikes via Ohvale and Polini scooters! Directly From Motorcycle Physics and Dynamics Text Books The roots of TDR have been intertwined from the very beginning with the most important academic papers regarding motorcycle dynamics (eg. V. Cossalter). We worked really hard to understand the physics regarding motorcycles to be able to replicate it as accurately as possible in this project. This is not pulled out of the air: everything is validated by industrial simulation formulas, such as Magic Formula by Pacjecka, which we used as foundation to create our tire physical model. Our intention was to build a game that could give an experience as faithful to real life as it can be. Realism but with fun! We are fully committed to creating a game that could offer the maximum realism available, but that could also be enjoyed with a simple Joypad and without frustration. TDR surely isn’t an Arcade game, which means that you will make some mistakes. A late braking, a wobble, an unwanted wheelie, one too much skid will ruin your lap. Thanks to a learning curve within anyone’s’ reach, the more you will race the more you will learn your limits and become a better rider with each lap. We surely want TDR to be the peak of the simulative experience, but also something to have lots of fun with! Tire dynamics wear Tires have a dynamic wear, that are physically simulated through the patch of contact of the rubber on the asphalt. Through the track conditions and your riding style you can determine the tire performance. High quality tracks an bikes models Our all tracks are reproductions of real circuits, made with the closest fidelity and high visual impact, thanks to the High Definition Render Pipeline. Even our bikes are reproductions of real motorcycles, made taking into account all the real sizes: tires, suspensions, forks, steer, wheelbase, all data are all faithfully reported in the simulation. Not only big wheels In TDR we don’t want to only simulate standard bikes, but we love to explore other growing branches, such as the one of the small wheels. We have been supported by a leading brand in the field such as Ohvale, which makes us feel extremely lucky. The Gp-0 is nowadays used as an official motorcycle to train a lot of professional riders, and we are happy to have it in official capacity in our game toghether with important brands like Polini, who made the fastest track racing scooter and YCF, one of the most important company that produce pitbikes. The small wheels will allow us to move the challenge to kart tracks and therefore open a whole new prospective over motorcycle simulation.", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "MadCow S.r.l.", "publisher": "MadCow S.r.l.", "game_tag": "Motocross", "minimum_ram": " 8192 MB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 20 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5-4460 or AMD FX-8120"},

This pack makes the entire Chaos Warrior race from the main game playable in the Grand Campaign and multiplayer matches; as well as adding entirely new Legendary Lords, Lords, Heroes, Units, Magic Items and more. Three new Legendary Lords. Lead the Chaos Warriors as one of three new Legendary Lords, each with their own unique bonuses: Sigvald the Magnificent: Beautiful from birth, Sigvald’s fondness for hedonistic excess saw him exiled from his tribe but also gained him a powerful patron: Slaanesh. Now, he heads an army devoted to himself. Slaying anything he deems ugly or unsavoury, he fights as much for his perverse ego as he does for Slaanesh. Kholek Suneater: Kholek Suneater is a formidable figure to behold. A gigantic Dragon Ogre, believed by many to be the second eldest of all Dragon Ogres, he towers over the battlefield swinging his gigantic hammer with ease. He is considered by some to be a God. Archaon the Everchosen: A former Sigmarite Templar, Archaon stumbled upon an ancient doctrine that contained within the secrets of his faith. Renouncing his allegiance to Sigmar he journeyed north to the dreaded Chaos Wastes to offer his service to the Chaos Gods. Here, the Ruinous Powers gave him their blessing to set out on his quest to become the Everchosen; the Lord of the End Times. New Horde playstyle Introduces Horde-style gameplay to Total War: WARHAMMER, allowing the Chaos Warriors to raze enemy settlements and set up encampments anywhere, taking their war spoils with them. The armies of Chaos rest only when exhaustion halts their marching, leaving nothing but corruption and ash in their wake. New units, buildings, items and technologies. Unlock new units, buildings and technologies. Seek out the powerful Artefacts of Chaos and become the true Herald of the Apocalypse. Spread corruption in the name of Chaos! The foul energies that drive the Chaos Warriors leave ripples that permeate any place they pass through, influencing the populace. Use this to spread dissent amongst the enemies of Chaos, creating cultist uprisings through the proliferation of dark worship. Key Units: Chaos Warriors. No longer fully human, the Chaos Warriors have been altered to become living weapons, honed perfectly to do their dark masters’ work. Imbued with the strength of chaos, enrobed in dark hell-forged armour, they can best several mortal warriors easily. They have no need for food, drink, sleep or other mortal comforts, subsisting on carnage alone. Chaos Dragon (Mount). Once, these great beasts sailed the skies as their brethren still do. Now, corrupted by change, these two-headed dragons are malevolent predators in their own right. One head spews forth dark flame, the other corrosive gas. Only the most powerful can ride such a monster, and even then it is only a temporary alliance, Chaos Dragons can never be tamed. Forsaken. Once proud men, their long-standing service to the Chaos Gods has left them altered. Where once they killed in the name of ambition and glory, their mutations have made them something less than human. Now they fight, whirlwinds of flailing flesh, hair and claw, only to satisfy their unending, unnatural hunger. Dragon Ogres. These magnificent, terrible beasts are amongst the most ancient and impressive of all living creatures. Their immortality is a gift from the Chaos Gods, given in exchange for an eternity of dark servitude. Seeking out lightning, they swing their gigantic weapons with ease, cleaving all but the most powerful warriors to ribbons. Gorebeast Chariot. A massive construction of hell-forged metal, mutant beast and jagged blade, the Gorebeast Chariot is ridden by some of the most powerful Warriors of Chaos and serves a single purpose: to shatter enemy lines with unstoppable force. Hellcannon. The Hellcannon is a massive artifice of metal and daemonic power that hurls bolts of raw arcane energy across the battlefield, vaporising anything in range. Part war machine, part Daemon, this infernal construct is powered by the liquefied remains of fallen enemies and operated by a sturdy crew of Chaos Dwarfs.

Chastened – but not yet broken – the Norse warlords have settled across Britain. For the first time in nearly 80 years, the land is in a fragile state of peace. Throughout this sceptred isle, the kings of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales sense a time of change approaching; a time of opportunity. There will be treaties. There will be war. There will be turns of fortune that become the stuff of legend, in a saga that charts the ascent of one of history’s greatest nations. Kings will rise. One will rule. Thrones of Britannia is a standalone Total War game which will challenge you to re-write a critical moment in history, one that will come to define the future of modern Britain. With ten playable factions, you must build and defend a kingdom to the glory of Anglo-Saxons, Gaelic clans, Welsh tribes or Viking settlers. Forge alliances, manage burgeoning settlements, raise armies and embark on campaigns of conquest across the most detailed Total War map to date. Choose your strategy The Grand Campaign offers multiple routes to a glorious Victory; aggressively expand your territory through force of arms, acquire renown through construction, advanced technology and influence, or complete a series of unique objectives based on your chosen faction’s history. Once completed, steady yourself for a significant late-game challenge and the final, Ultimate victory condition. Explore and conquer the British Isles From the snowy highlands of Scotland to the orchards and meadows of Kent, push back the fog-of-war and unveil the extent of Anglo-Saxon Britain.

Embark on Viking expeditions, manage the Anglo-Saxon peasant economy, each faction feels and plays differently. Carve out unique roles for your King and Nobles, customise their impact by making meaningful choices about their development and determine how their story will unfold. ‘Classic’ Total War gameplay refined Includes many updates to core Total War mechanics - such as provinces, politics, technologies, recruitment, dilemmas and much more - designed to make your experience more immersive and more meaningful. Playable factions, cultures and kings: Thrones of Britannia will include ten playable factions, from five cultures, with a summary below. The Anglo Saxons – West Seaxe and Mierce When Roman rule in England concluded, new kingdoms of Germanic stock coalesced in the counties now known as Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, Essex, Sussex, East Anglia and Kent. The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons. West Seaxe Faction Leader: King Alfred As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe – or Wessex in modern English – provided the isle’s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred’s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD. Mierce Faction Leader: Ceowulf From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce – known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle. The Gaels – Mide and Circenn Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland. With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba – essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. Mide Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title. With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away… the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy? Circenn Faction Leader: Áed mac Cináeda Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn’s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist – both within and without. Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone’s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking… The Welsh – Gwined and Strat Clut The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. Ironically, the term ‘Welsh’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, ‘wealas’, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. Gwined Faction Leader: King Anaraut The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves ‘English’. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. Strat Clut Faction Leader: Run Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run. The Great Viking Army – Northymbre and East Engle In 865 AD, Ragnar’s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred’s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered. Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle – provided they kept Alfred’s peace, of course. Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence… Northymbre Faction Leader: Guthfrid When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York – or Eoferwic, as was – for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle’s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual. Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred’s peace. East Engle Faction Leader: Guthrum Forming the bulk of Britannia’s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army’s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Æthelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw. Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight. The Viking Sea Kings – Dyflin and Sudreyar After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred’s defeat of the Great Viking army. These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique. Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England’s upstart ruler… Dyflin Faction Leader: Bardr Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia’s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. By 878 AD however, Imar’s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one’s warrior-blood… Sudreyar Faction Leader: Eirik To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy. Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area. Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "publisher": "CREATIVE ASSEMBLY", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 5 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 30 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3-2100 or AMD equivalent"},

In Rebel Inc: Escalation, the war is ‘over’ - but we all know that doesn't mean anything. In order to stabilise a war-torn country, you need to balance competing military and civilian priorities to win the hearts and minds of the people, whilst also stopping a deadly insurgency from seizing power! Following on from the global mega hit 'Plague Inc.' with over 160 million players, Rebel Inc: Escalation offers a deeply engaging, strategic challenge inspired by the complexities and consequences of modern counter insurgency. It has received acclaim from international development experts and was even featured at a major international peace conference! 8 regions to stabilise - Deploy to wildly different strategic environments, including the gentle farms of ‘Saffron Fields’, or the impenetrable forests of ‘Distant Steppe’. Work to defend the ‘Azure Dam’ from the Insurgency, or develop unique new strategies to counter the drug trade in ‘Opium Fields’. 8 unique governors - Each one with radical new abilities to master. Choose the ‘Economist’ to receive an entire year’s income in one go or the ‘Warlord’ to train a personal militia. Field an army of heavy armour with the ‘Tank Commander’, or tap into the black-market with the ‘Smuggler’. Hyper-realistic - Inspired by Afghanistan, the simulation is highly detailed, containing real world development initiatives and an innovative representation of counter insurgency tactics. It has been praised by the World Bank and was even featured at a major international peace conference. Campaign Mode - Conduct large-scale operations across multiple regions. Carefully manage resources and choose unique upgrades in a persistent world with 150+ Player Tactics, Map Features and Insurgent Tactics to radically mix up gameplay!

Take on the ultimate challenge and step into a new level of simulation. From the talent of TSG comes a new, greatly enhanced rendition of the DB BR 101 locomotive for Train Sim World®, complete with unparalleled, in-depth screen functionality, operational failures and of course, the IC Steuerwagen! In the early 1990s, a majority of Germany’s express passenger services were operated by ageing locomotives, including the DB BR 103 and DB BR 120. Both had been hauling heavier trains than they were designed for, resulting in damage over time, poor reliability rates and rising maintenance costs. Germany was in desperate need of a new express passenger locomotive. DB signed a deal with ABB which would develop into an order of 145 locomotives, with the first locomotive completed by July 1996. With ABB merging with AEG to form ADtranz, locomotives would be built quicker in multiple locations. The first of the new DB BR 101 officially entered service in February 1997. In the subsequent 27 years, the BR 101 has proven itself to be a capable, high-speed passenger locomotive – working as the backbone of DB’s Inter-City services throughout Germany. In Train Sim World®, TSG have taken the existing DB BR 101, originally released for Train Sim World 2, and transformed it into TSW’s first Expert/Study Level loco add-on! Rebuilt from the ground up, the DB BR 101 now features a full in-depth simulation including; overhauled physics, full internal simulation with machine room and all interactive fuses, temperature simulation, fault simulation, authentic PZB data entry, GSM-R and more. Accompanying the BR 101 is the sleek and popular IC cab car! Built with the same level of simulation, the Bpmmbdzf 286.1 allows for fully authentic push-pull Inter-City services throughout Germany. Please Note: For the full experience, we recommend you own Train Sim World®: Bahnstrecke Salzburg - Rosenheim and/or Train Sim World®: Nahverkehr Dresden - Riesa which are available as separate purchases.

Includes the Portugal civilization with João III, the Nau unique unit, and two unique structures, the Navigation School building and the Feitoria. Civ Unique Ability: Portugal’s unique ability, “Casa Da Índia,” significantly increases the yields of International Trade Routes, but limits those routes to cities on the coast or with a Harbor. This ability also grants Trader units additional range and the ability to embark on water tiles as soon as they’re unlocked. Leader Unique Ability: Joao’s unique ability is “Porta Do Cerco,” which grants all units increased Sight. It also increases Trade Route capacity whenever Portugal meets a new civ and provides Open Borders with all city-states. Unique Unit: Portugal’s unique unit, the Nau, is a naval melee unit that replaces the Caravel. It starts with one free Promotion, requires less maintenance than the Caravel, and has two charges to build Feitorias, special shipping ports unique to Portugal. Unique Infrastructure: Portugal has access to two unique structures. Portugal’s unique building, the Navigation School, replaces the University building and increases Production toward naval units in each city that builds it. It also increases a city’s Science yields for every two coastal or lake tiles within the city’s borders and grants additional Great Admiral points. The Feitoria can only be built by a Nau unit on a foreign city’s coastal tile next to a luxury or bonus resource. Sending a Trade Route to a city with a Feitoria provides Portugal with additional Gold and Production. New “Zombies Defense” Game Mode The Portugal pack also introduces the new Zombies Defense  game mode. In this optional game mode, the dead don’t stay dead for long and present an ever-growing threat to the world’s civilizations. BRAINS! The Dead Don’t Rest: Every unit has a chance to respawn as a ravenous Zombie when it dies. Zombie units hunger after and attack the nearest non-Zombie unit; any units they slay succumb to the infection and respawn as Zombies themselves. The Living Fight Back: An arsenal of new trap and barricade improvements deal damage to hostile units that pass through or near them and can be built in owned or neutral territory. Zombies’ obsession with brain-banquets and digestive-devastation means they can only fall victim to these improvements and never pillage them. Humanity Takes Control: Two new projects allow civilizations to temporarily subjugate Zombie units within a city’s limits, putting them under player control. The “Holy Site: Turn Undead” project unlocks early, but controls Zombies only briefly. The “Campus: Horde Control” project unlocks later in the game, but grants additional turns with which to command Zombies’ mindless mayhem. Meanwhile, the “Zombie Outbreak” spy operation attempts to spawn Zombies on worked tiles in another player’s city. New map script and new World Wonders: The Portugal content pack also includes a new map script and two new World Wonders: Wetlands Map Script: Squelch your way to victory through a soggy map dominated by Marshes. This map offers new strategic challenges and defensive possibilities: while Marshes penalize Movement, careful positioning can allow ranged units to exploit enemies’ reduced speed. Torre de Belém World Wonder: This imposing tower historically served as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon in Portugal. Grants additional Gold and Great Admiral Points. International Trade Routes embarking from this city receive additional Gold for every Luxury Resource at the destination. When constructed, any cities owned by the civilization but located on other continents receive the cheapest building they can construct at that time. Etemenanki World Wonder: The name of this Babylonian ziggurat translates to “temple of the foundation of heaven and earth.” It grants additional Science yields every turn, as well as bonus Science and Production to all Floodplains in the city that builds it and Marsh tiles in that civilization.", "review_summary": "Mixed", "developer": "Firaxis Games", "publisher": "Firaxis Games", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 17 MB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 2.5 Ghz or AMD Phenom II 2.6 Ghz or greater"},

Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. Turn-Based Tactical RPG: ● The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits… and more. ● Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions… with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! ● Build your own classes : upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! ● Manage your squad of heroes: they’re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good balance. Hordes of Evil: ● Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. ● Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites ! ● Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses . Protect the Haven: ● Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! ● Build up your defenses : walls, traps, towers, catapults… every tiny bit of help is welcome. ● Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. ● 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: ● The game is meant to be hard . You will fail… A lot. But every time you do, you’ll grow harder, better, faster, stronger! ● Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses. ● Tailor each run thanks to the Omens : a limited amount of bonuses that can be picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters, sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of destruction. ● Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain even the most hardcore players.

Your father mysteriously vanished before you were born. But hey, you've had plenty of time to work out and dream about the wonders of the world. Sucks to be you though. People eat slime, corruption is rife, and everyone wants to fight you... But maybe if you can find your father and become the 'Dark Fist' people whisper about, somehow you could actually be humanity's savior, and the one who uncovers the super-secret secrets of the Good Corporation... Or not. It's a choose your own adventure. Stay in the garage if you want. Back when things weren't so cyberpunk, a nameless cool guy rose from the streets, punched out the big and bad, found his father and it was all good. Welcome to the future. It's corrupt, we use sea shells instead of toilet paper, and everything is cyberpunk now. The streets are familiar, but now there's lots of neon. Dive into an adventure filled with hilarity, 80’s nostalgia, and punching. Even more punching than before! Punch, kick, or even cheat your way through if that's your style. Becoming the best damn fighter aint easy. It takes time, training, dedication, and dollars! Build up your stats and techniques, plan your match and create your own incredibly awesome school of fighting! Sounds better than losing and everyone laughing at you, right? While nothing beats good old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears, neuro training and illegal software sure sound tempting. And only a minor risk you’ll be exposed as a fraud right before your last brain cell packs up and leaves. Life in the rat race is fast-paced, time-consuming, and requires effective management to survive. Just like Punch Club 2! It’s literally a simulation game! Manage your time and funds, while you climb the ranks of the fight leagues. Meanwhile you'll have to find work, either for the police, the mob, the mafia, or just about anyone else you cross paths with.

Exanima's exceptional attention to detail and realistic simulation of all things aim to provide a deeply immersive and dynamic gameplay experience. Features include a deep skill based combat system, complex and smart AI, fully interactive environments, an advanced damage model with accurate collisions and locational protection, roguelike elements and an arena mode to hone your combat skills. \"Those who would enter the underworld shall not only forfeit their lives... ...but bring oblivion to all mankind.\" WARNING: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT! This game features a very deep, truly physics based combat system. This is not just some animation feature, it is a fundamental difference that is central to gameplay. Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of your inputs is crucial to the outcome. This will likely be unlike anything you've played before and may take some practice, but can be hugely rewarding and the skill cap is virtually infinite. It is not particularly fast paced or difficult but it does require you to pay attention, it is very tactical and just casually pressing buttons won't get you very far! Our goal is to create a deep and immersive RPG world based on a more advanced simulation supporting an unprecedented level of dynamic and emergent gameplay. All of the technology we use including the game engine is our own, developed from the ground up to realise this vision. Exanima is born as a prelude to Sui Generis (SG), our ambitious open world RPG that has been in development for over two years following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Exanima is a smaller yet complete game in its own right, a dungeon crawler that takes place in SG's Underworld some twenty years prior to its events. Both games are being developed in concert, many of SG's more ambitious features will make an appearance in Exanima as development continues. Exanima provides a reasonably complete and meaningful game experience, but many more features are on their way! We have met our most challenging and significant development goals, now we are ready to bring new features to light and make an even more fun and compelling adventure. Here are some of the planned features, with many already being close to completion: Per session and global character skill progression Large non-linear main game following early content Build and permanently save characters by completing early content New encounters, items and environments Ranged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres Numerous moddable thaumaturgic powers More complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas Complex NPC interactions and dialogue Cooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Bare Mettle Entertainment", "publisher": "Bare Mettle Entertainment", "game_tag": "Physics", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 10 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 3"},

Specialized sensors and advanced multi-mode ECM pods give it the capability to find, target, and wreak havoc on all kinds of enemy transmissions. Smartly managing the various systems can be a complex task, so another player can enter the rear seat as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO). AN/ALQ-245 Multi-mode Electronic Countermeasure Pod This special piece of equipment is the pinnacle of ECM technology. It can transmit low, medium, and high frequencies in various modes: Noise: Barrage the target with noise to reduce its ability to detect meaningful signals. Depending on the frequency, this can affect radar detection, GPS, communications, etc. DRFM: Digital Radio Frequency Memory is a technique where incoming radar signals are processed and returned to the sender to create false contacts and pull off locks. SAS: The Signal Augmentation System allows the pod to reshape its radar return in order to appear as a different kind of aircraft on the target's radar. ADM-160J Air-launched Decoy/Jammer This jet-powered missile can be deployed to fly orbits around target locations or follow a GPS path. It carries the same signature augmentation system, giving it the ability to appear like a fighter, bomber, or any other aircraft on radar. It can also operate in jamming mode to help suppress enemy air defenses. It maintains a datalink with your aircraft so it can be updated while in-flight with new routes or targets, and share its RWR contacts for triangulation and analysis. Sensor Fusion and Datalink The Mischief utilizes 5th generation tactical systems like the F-45, with additions and modifications to help it excel in EW. It automatically links up with teammates to triangulate radar positions, gather information on target frequencies and configurations, and provide you with all the information you need to carry on your mission. Variable Sweep Wings The EF-24's swing wings allow it to reach high top speeds while still being able to operate off an aircraft carrier. The ECM pods deploy ram air turbine intakes when necessary to feed power hungry operations, but the aircraft's aerodynamic configuration allows it to maintain supersonic flight even in the draggiest state. Sensor Displays Analyze the EM environment in the FRAZ (Frequency/Azimuth) display, and get a read on the general signals being detected in all directions on the TSD. Take full control of the radar while still being able to quickly and easily designate targets on the TSD. Weapons Take on radar targets with various types of anti-radiation missiles.

Over the course of the game you join them as they swim, fly, roll and chomp their way to the open ocean from the far-flung corners of Barnardshire (the smallest county in England) in their bid for freedom and to re-unite once again. FINTASTIC FRIENDS Meet our heroes! Goldfish - cheerful, brave, and adventurous, a natural born swimmer!  Pufferfish – a little slow but kind-hearted who can also puff up into a ball and roll across land. Piranha - wild, chaotic, loud, unpredictable, and loves to bite - obviously. Flying Fish – a little aloof at times but a real softy at heart, with the ability to glide through the air! These plucky heroes will leave no bowl unturned, putting their heart and shoal into the mission to re-unite! NO NEED TO BE A BRAIN STURGEON Swim, roll, glide, chomp, flip flop, inflate, fly and bite your way through enthralling challenges. A simple, intuitive control scheme leaves no excuses should your fish perish leaving you feeling very gill-ty. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOWL With its idyllic coastline and quaint villages Barnardshire might seem like a perfect slice of quintessential tranquility, but to our aquatic adventurers it’s alive with the very real threats presented by crossing roads, traversing rooftops, dodging deep fat fryers, avoiding wildlife including the cantankerous locals, not to mention fragile fishbowls and the very real problem that fish can’t breathe out of water. LEAVE NO FISH BEHIND We won’t dwell on grizzly fish death, but should your fish fall too far in whatever make-shift fishbowl it finds itself in, run out of air or generally flounder you will be popped back to the most recent checkpoint to refine your approach. SWIM TO FREEDOM Our four fin-tastic friends will be hitching rides in all manner of ad hoc water carriers including jars, mop buckets on wheels and the occasional pint glass. Cheers! Navigating in each make-shift aquatic vehicle poses its own unique challenge, but don’t worry, the relative freedom of open water is never too far away with inviting fountains, swimming pools and err, sewers full of hazardous materials to splash around in, before reaching the final goal – the shimmering, open ocean. BE CAREFUL YOU DON’T FLOUNDER Whilst I Am Fish may look like a piece of hake to play, actshoally the controls are deliberately designed to be challenging and with an additional layer of added Bossa Style controls, it won’t be like shooting fish in a barrel.

COTA - Circuit of the Americas The project for the first US-based circuit aiming to cater for all major track racing series started back in 2010, in Austin (Texas). The circuit features some highly complex sections, driven at very high average speeds. At 5.5 kilometres long, it is situated on a hilly area, which brings some very impressive short braking zones mixed with straights where it is easy to gain speed in an incredibly short amount of time. With all major events selling out, the circuit is close to the hearts of the locals, holding a record attendance of 400,000 people in a single race weekend. Indianapolis Motor Speedway Have you ever seen a place where a racing track is so important that a city is named after it? Well, Indianapolis is such a place, as it is located in a city called \"Speedway\". The circuit is the second most ancient race circuit in all of humanity, built in 1909, just two years after Brookland (UK), the very first one to exist. This should tell you a lot about the huge motorsport culture this place in Indiana (USA) holds in its heritage. Everything around here is completely absorbed by the passion for engines, speed, tyres and everything attached to a racing vehicle. Indianapolis has been known for ages for its impressive oval section, which features an extreme banking for high-speed racing. As a motorsport capital, the circuit has been able to evolve, and now also features an FIA Grade 1 layout, which is home to the Indianapolis 8 Hour for the Intercontinental GT Challenge by SRO and many other racing categories across all disciplines. Carl G. Fisher would be very proud of the heritage he created for the entire motorsport industry. Watkins Glen International Watkins Glen, close to Seneca Lake in the state of New York (USA), was first opened in 1956, and it was built to relocate motor racing events previously held in near villages and roads to a proper circuit. It has been home to major racing disciplines throughout its history, in which it has become very popular as the \"Mecca\" of North American motorsports. Initially, racing activities in this area were fuelled by Cameron Argetsinger, whose family's summer residence was located nearby. The family collaborated with local authorities and started organizing racing events, giving life to the future circuit that also provided the venue for the Unites States of America Grand Prix for years. All of these 3 new circuits will come alongside a new Assetto Corsa Competizione update, featuring new liveries and improvements for all players.

Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating allowing you to improve the area by improving public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. You are free to go at your own pace and take it easy. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "MassHive Media", "publisher": "MassHive Media", "game_tag": "Singleplayer", "minimum_ram": " 6 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 2 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3-2100 or AMD Phenom II X4 965"},

Reinforcements are deployed on the frontlines as war intensifies. The high commands of the four armies fighting over the control of Gladius Prime send in squads that could tip the balance of power. But a new insidious enemy lurks in the shadows: they have bid their time, and they are now ready to strike… The Reinforcement Pack brings five new units to the battlefields of Gladius Prime! One new unit per faction, plus one for neutrals, filling a new role in battle and increasing the strategical options available to all commanders. Tempestus Scions (Astra Militarum) Militarum Tempestus Scions are often viewed with fear or resentment by the regular troops - nicknames such as 'glory boys' and 'big toy soldiers' are common. Yet this rancour is nothing to the Scions themselves. Trained in covert operations and rapid insertion strike-tactics, they go to battle confident that their every deed is for the good of the Imperium itself. Immortals (Necrons) Even before biotransference, the Immortals were the elite soldiers of the Necrontyr and marched at the forefront of their galactic conquests. Reborn into tireless metal bodies, they are now the shock troops of each tomb world's armies. Where Necron Warriors are but fodder to be fed to the guns of the foe, Immortals are far more valuable to their Overlords and will be deployed accordingly. Heavily armed and armoured, they will stop at nothing in the completion of their masters' goals, and will often be found at the heart of any crushing offensive or punitive counter-attack. Flash Gitz (Orks) Amongst the richest and most obnoxious of their warlike breed, Flash Gitz travel the galaxy engaging in acts of outrageous piracy and wanton vandalism. They hire themselves out as mercenaries to Ork warbands, basking in the envy of Boyz jealous of their flashy kit and prodigious dakka. Despite their ostentation, Flash Gitz give a Warboss all the killpower he pays for. Completely lethal in gun battles, boarding actions and the like, a mob of Gitz opening fire is nothing short of cataclysmic. A punishing hail of energy bolts and bullets fills the air, the Flash Gitz’ victims coming apart amid sprays of blood and blossoms of flame before the Gitz stomp the life out of anyone left standing. Land Raider (Space Marines) The ground trembles and enemies flee in fear as the mighty Land Raider advances into battle. Massively armoured and all but unstoppable, the noble war engine smashes through walls and grinds over wreckage while drumming volley after volley of fire into the foe. Beams of incandescent energy slam into enemy tanks, knifing through their armoured hulls and reducing them to blazing fireballs. Thudding bolt shells punch into the flesh of the foe before detonating in shocking sprays of gore. The kill count climbs with each passing moment as the Land Raider advances across the war zone, especially once the tank’s assault ramp slams down and its Adeptus Astartes passengers charge out to add to the carnage. Neophyte Hybrids (Neutral) Each cultist is spry and tough of build - weathered over a lifetime of hard labour, their physical strength and reaction is bolstered by the alien genes lurking within. Neophyte Hybrids do not bear the outward hallmarks of the Patriarch's sacred touch; as their brood leaders tell them, their blessings are of the soul more than the body. These third and fourth generation hybrids can pass for human - some are even cunning enough to infiltrate the Astra Militarum. When the cult goes on the attack, these Neophytes show their true colours. Surging from sewers, catacombs and shadowy barracks, they swarm their enemies in such number they can seize control of a planet's defences within the first hours of conquest.", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "Proxy Studios", "publisher": "Proxy Studios", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 2 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or equivalent"},

A Dystopian Dreamland It’s 2099 and alien knowledge has caused rapid advancements in technology to the point that big corporations now sponsor planets.

Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people. Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point. How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are. Spend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav. Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own. Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter. For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless?

The darkness is an entity of evil. Some say it is the manifestation of human fear and nightmares, others say it is a wandering mass of damned souls haunting us. The origin of the darkness itself is unknown, but one thing for certain is that we can keep it at bay through the power of light and fire. Brace yourself against huge tidal waves of Nightmares.

These new units are entirely focused on offensive power and mobility. Enact new tactics and bold new aggressive strategies by fielding them on the wartorn surface of Gladius. Astra Militarum - Chimera Amphibious transport unit with manned weaponry and communication equipment. The Chimera is the most prolific and popular armoured transport used by the Imperial Guard. It is rugged, versatile, and easy to produce in huge numbers. For thousands of years it has been accepted wisdom that the Chimera punches well above its weight in a firefight; the tank itself mounts a variety of punishing anti-personnel weaponry, while passengers can lay down additional fire from its spacious top hatch and flank-mounted lasgun arrays. Tyranids - Scythed Hierodule Agile gargantuan creature unit that shreds entire armies. The Scythed Hierodule was first recorded during the invasion of Hamman's World, a small Imperial colony close to one of the tendrils of Hive Fleet Kraken. Hamman's World was attacked soon after Kraken's defeat on Ichar IV as the hive fleet began to splinter. Nothing like the Hierodule has ever been reported before. It is armed with four huge razor-sharp claws, each capable of slicing clean through a battle tank, and heavily protected by chitin plates, in places up to 30 cm thick. A Hierodule is far larger than a Carnifex and is a monstrous-killing machine, even by Tyranid standards. T'au - Tidewall Gunrig Heavily armed fortification that can be moved by transporting troops. With its in-built rail weaponry, the Tidewall Gunrig provides the firepower to deal with heavy enemy assault units or advancing ranks of armour. Manned by hard-eyed Fire Warriors, these mobile turrets mount devastating railguns that are more than capable of ripping apart enemy tanks or monstrous beasts with volleys of hyper-sonic rounds. Orks - Warbiker Fast skirmish unit with high fire power. Mobs of Ork Warbikers race into battle at suicidal speeds, exhausts belching greasy clouds of smoke. As they hurtle toward the enemy ranks, the Warbikers fill the air with a murderous storm of shots from their blazing dakkaguns. Surrounded by billowing clouds of smoke and dust, the Warbikers are protected from the worst of the enemy’s return fire – by the time the bikeboyz thunder out of this swirling cloud, they are all but on top of the foe. Necrons - Flayed One Close combat infantry unit that ignores enemy overwatch. Flayed Ones can materialise at any time, lured from their bleak dimension by the scent of blood and carnage, and will commonly stalk their prey before attacking with little regard for strategy. When the moment to strike comes, Flayed Ones scramble madly into battle, slashing at their prey with twisted talons and draping themselves in the mangled body parts of their quarry. Chaos Space Marines - Chaos Land Raider Massively armoured and heavily armed transport unit. The Chaos Land Raider is among the mightiest ground vehicles in a Chaos Space Marine army. Its adamantine and ceramite plates can withstand all but the deadliest anti-tank weaponry, and the blessings of the Warpsmiths keep it at peak efficiency. The twin lascannons mounted in each sponson make short work of other vehicles that would dare to attempt to stop its rampage. Space Marines - Razorback Tank unit that transports infantry. The Razorback rolls into battle with its weapons charged and ready to fire. Its determined crew slam their vehicle through obstacles and over wreckage, keeping pace with the Adeptus Astartes’ advance. Meanwhile, inside the vehicle’s transport bay, its passengers ready themselves for the battle ahead.", "review_summary": "Positive", "developer": "Proxy Studios", "publisher": "Proxy Studios", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 1 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 or equivalent"},

While marveling at the magic of reality and the pressure of life, we are addicted to games. Games are the ninth art form, with strong inclusiveness. We have found that there are many types that are very niche, but have a small circle of players belonging to that group. Our game genre is somewhere between interactive dramas and games, and we hope to incorporate more elements of criminal investigation, suspense, or other elements into the medium of love movies and games. Provide a more diverse display for love movies and games. ending In the development of interactive romantic video games, we have witnessed the peak of several games and the disappointment they have brought to players. We listen to the voices of players. Thank you very much for opening up this theme, which allowed our production team to come together and bring this work to all gamers. I believe everyone was attracted by the excellent plot and excellent dialogue arrangement, but in the beginning, everyone went in the wrong direction. Perhaps many people have an unforgettable opposite sex companion during their childhood, and when you are getting married, how will she face it emotionally. Each conversation is carefully designed to give players the most authentic feeling of love. You will face various choices and intertwined emotions, gradually uncovering the secrets of memories, while finding your true love in these beautiful and moving stories. In terms of dubbing, we use the original actor's dubbing method. In some event environments, we have increased the volume of tone words and some nasal and oral sounds. Further enhance the audio-visual experience, hoping to provide players with a better experience. Get ready for this challenging and romantic journey!

With a total of six new units, this DLC is a must-have and will enlarge the strategic options to all players. As war rages on, all the factions engaged in a fierce struggle to dominate Gladius Prime resort to erecting mighty bulwarks and deploying new state-of-the-art defensive weapons. Space Marines - Aquila Macro-Cannon Macro-cannon Aquila Strongpoints are massive fortifications, often used as bastions in Imperial defensive battle lines. Each consists of a munitions silo, topped by a large turret that houses the huge macro-cannon that gives the strongpoint its name. The munitions silo allows the Aquila Macrocannon to fire special \"Quake Shells,\" each of which measures several Terran feet in length and has a powerful charge that causes the shells to reach hypersonic velocity when the Macrocannon is fired. Astra Militarum - Void Shield Generator Void shields are normally localised force fields reserved for protecting the monolithic Titans of the Adeptus Mechanicus, but static generators can be erected to serve as an aegis for other targets of vital import. The largest Void Shield generators can even project an invisible bubble of power across a large area of the battlefield, sheltering both troops and strategically vital battlefield locations by absorbing or deflecting the energy of incoming munitions. Chaos Space Marines - Noctilith Crown Noctilith Crowns are brutal edifices raised up by the Chaos Space Marines to weaken the very foundations of reality. Crafted from the mysterious material known as blackstone, these vast psychic resonators thin the veil to deadly effect, shielding your own units and damaging enemy psykers. Necrons - Gauss Pylon The mysterious Necron defence turrets, designated as 'Pylons' by those who originally encountered them, were first recorded on the uncharged world of WDY-272. Rising suddenly from the desert sands, the Gauss Pylons opened fire without warning and with devastating effect, tanks and armoured carriers burning as the crescent-shaped weapons tore through the unsuspecting Imperial Guard column whilst resisting all return fire. Orks - Big Mek Especially talented or popular Mekboyz will soon attract a following, lording it over a growing gang of underlings. A Mek with this much clout is referred to as a Big Mek, and can prove indispensable to the local Warboss with his knowledge of shokk attack guns, force field technology, and tellyporta rigs. Tyranids - Biovores A Biovore is a squat, bloated creature -- yet no less deadly for all that. Deep within its lumpen form, the Biovore nurtures a clutch of Spore Mines -- living bombs that blanket the enemy in acids, poisons and shrapnel-sized pieces of chitin.

An old-school turn-based battle system combines with inspiration from unexplored mythology to offer an RPG experience that feels unique yet also familiar. An unknown force has abducted the Sun King Napkiraly, leaving Operencia in a state of perpetual darkness – and eventual doom. From hidden royal tombs and cursed castles to an ascent up the World Tree to reach the Copper Forest of the Land of the Gods, explore diverse settings throughout the far reaches of the land…and beyond. Each location boasts its own unique atmosphere, visual style, level design and puzzles, and many take place entirely outdoors. Operencia is home to an intriguing mix of unexplored mythology and fantastical versions of actual historical locations (e.g., Deva Fortress, Balvanyos) and characters (e.g., Attila, Seven Chieftains of the Magyars), all coming together to form one cohesive new gaming universe. Several of your own seven party members take influence from heroes of forgotten tales told hundreds of years ago, such as the brave knight Mezey and Sebastian the Dragon Slayer. Along with a deeply strategic turn-based battle system full of spells and special skills to execute, tile-based movement encourages thorough exploration of each area. For added challenge, turn on Cartographer mode to plot out each of the 13 maps yourself. How many secrets will you find?

Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 “Huey”: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 “Loach”: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G “Cobra”: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian “Bushranger”: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 “grease gun”, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forces’ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their “home field advantage”, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can’t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right “Ho Chi Minh Trail” ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team’s spawning rate, when times get desperate “Ambush Spawn” ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Antimatter Games", "publisher": "Antimatter Games", "game_tag": "FPS", "minimum_ram": " 4 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 60 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i3 @ 2.5GHz or AMD Phenom @ 2.5GHz"},

Deep simulation mechanics capture the unique challenges of surviving the harsh winters and carving a thriving settlement out of the northern forest. Lead your goblins to greatness! We're Korppi Games, a three-person games company in southern Finland. We're lifelong gamers who want to make deep, thoughtful video games. In Goblin Camp, you're in charge of a little encampment of goblins. If you manage your settlement successfully, it can grow from a collection of shacks and lean-tos into a bustling city of stone and brick. You'll harness lots of different resources to build your camp, but the most important tool at your disposal will be your growing population of goblins. Each of them has their own combination of skills, traits and personality quirks, and as they do things and have experiences, they'll learn new skills and develop new abilities. To make managing all this as easy as possible, you can easily access all the information you need about your camp at a glance in our manager interfaces. They'll show you exactly what tools and materials you have, how much food you're producing, and alert you to any trouble. Goblin Camp takes place on procedurally generated maps, where we simulate the effects of glaciation and the kind of geography that emerges in its wake. Because each map is different, every game will be too. The forest in Goblin Camp is more than just the trees. The game simulates how the forest grows after the glaciers recede, and it keeps on growing and evolving throughout the game. As your settlement grows, the decisions you make will have an impact on the woods around it, and eventually the whole map. Of course, nature isn't just there for your convenience. You'll have to help your goblins survive the harsh winters and the extreme weather. Our advanced water simulation is there to create both opportunities for water engineering and the occasional spring flood, but look out for strong winds blowing fires toward your camp! Goblin Camp is set in a world that draws inspiration from the fantasy classics we know and love, and from ancient Finnic mythology. These ancient beliefs and ways of life, almost completely forgotten even in Finland, give a unique twist to the Goblin Camp experience. You'll have to deal with the spirits of the forest: tapping their energies to power your own magic, and defending your goblins from their menaces. They're not the only trouble, either: your camp may be menaced by various beasts, humans and monsters, even elves - especially if you've been raiding their settlements! In Goblin Camp, you can unlock new advances through magic or technology - or both. Travel to the spirit world in search of the secrets of the old magic, or develop industrial machinery through engineering. Either way will open new possibilities to grow your settlement and remake the world in your image. Your task is to guide your goblins on their way to greatness. The decisions you make, large or small, will have a real impact on your settlement and the broader game world. As your camp grows, the game grows around it as well. Gameplay in Goblin Camp will scale up as your settlement gets bigger: you can stay involved in the little details if you like, but the interface will free you to concentrate on the big picture. All in all, Goblin Camp delivers a rich settlement-building experience in a multi-faceted, living fantasy world. As you face the unique challenges of surviving the harsh boreal winters and carving a thriving settlement out of the primeval woods, your choices determine what kind of civilization will emerge in the frozen north. Experience Goblin Camp just how you like it with our broad array of customization options. Choose which terrain features appear on the map and which enemies spawn, or play in Peaceful Mode for a relaxing experience with no enemies at all. You can also choose game mechanics: if raging fires and spring floods aren't your thing, or you don't want to make your Midsummer sacrifices to the forest-spirits, go ahead and switch them off when you start the game.

We hold no legal claim over any IP created in Smack Studio, and we'd love for artists to create, share, monetize, and do what they please with it! IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT CREATING ART FOR OTHER PROJECTS: The maximum canvas size is currently 256x256 pixels. We may be able to increase this in the future, but we can't guarantee it at this point. The ideal height for characters is between 50 and 150 pixels tall. Images significantly smaller or larger than these limits can still be used, but they are a challenge for the 3D algorithm and may require more manual cleanup after exporting. Please note our hardware recommendations. Smack Studio is more performance intensive than most other pixel art animation software, due to our 3D rotation and our integration with Unreal Engine.

A reverse city builder Use advanced eco-technology to purify the soil, creating plains, wetlands, beaches, rainforests, wildflowers, and more—then efficiently recycle everything you've built, leaving the environment pristine for its new animal inhabitants. Different maps every time Procedurally generated landscapes mean no two playthroughs of Terra Nil will ever be the same. Plan your build around randomized, challenging, and unpredictable terrain, including snaking rivers, mountains, lowlands, and oceans. A natural ebb and flow Each region of Terra Nil progresses through phases, with the ultimate goal being leaving pristine wilderness behind. Levels are not about infinite growth, but rather balancing and nurturing the environment before leaving it in peace. Experience tranquility Lush hand-painted environments, relaxing music, and an atmospheric ambient soundscape make Terra Nil a peaceful, meditative experience. When you're done, use Appreciate mode to bask in the natural beauty of the ecosystem you have restored.", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "Free Lives", "publisher": "Free Lives", "game_tag": "Nature", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 2 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5-4590 / AMD FX-8350"},

A ferocious Arachnid onslaught has swept through the city’s suburbs, completely overwhelming local police forces. Never before did they face such a massive and meticulously orchestrated assault. Majestic boulevards and towering skyscrapers are reduced to rubble as the Bug hordes encroach upon the central districts. The very homes of our citizens are now in grave peril… PROTECT & SERVE A strong police force has been keeping the peace in the streets of Mahanagar. It is even trained and equipped to deal with the minor Arachnid outbreaks that sometimes occur in the outer districts. Police Squad Each Police Squad operates a pair of detainer drones, designed to take down crime suspects - or distract the attention of Arachnids. Riot Shield Squad Their big shields and heavy armor are designed to resist enemy attacks and their grenade launchers can whittle down even the biggest enemies. Peacekeeper Biped This command vehicle can call in reinforcements, boost the damage output of friendly units and provide indirect fire support with its dual grenade launchers. MILITARY MIGHT The current Arachnid incursion, however, calls for a much stronger response. The Mobile Infantry has arrived to preserve freedom and smash the Bugs! They’ve brought the latest war machines to quell even the most vicious Arachnid threats. J.A.C. Trooper The \"Jumpjet Assault Cannon\" Trooper carries a large recoilless rifle to smash through medium armor and a jetpack to take them to the high ground - or to get out of trouble. M7 Cyclone This highly mobile weapon platform can fire on the move to deal with both ground and air targets, and a booster jump ability to reach advantageous positions. M23 Rainmaker When you need an endless storm of missiles to rain down upon your enemy, deploy the Rainmaker. This mobile missile launcher excels at providing long range fire support. A-12 Pegasus Gunship Take control of the skies with the Pegasus Gunship. Its powerful minigun and wing-mounted rocket pods are ideal for ground support missions. HOLD THE LINE To stem the tide, a whole new set of defensive turrets is available for deployment. No matter what the Arachnids throw at our positions, we have a combination of turrets ready to throw them back. Autocannon Turret This sturdy turret can take a lot of punishment, and its dual autocannons are effective against medium armored enemies but tend to overheat quickly. Mortar Turret This turret fires a barrage of mortar rounds to counter large hordes of lightly armored enemies. Heavy Gun Turret This weapon mounts a high velocity gun designed to take on heavily armored targets. Ballistic Missile Turret When your defenses are under long range bombardment, deploy these turrets. Its heat seeking missiles can take down enemies from a great distance. KNOW YOUR ENEMY Federal Intelligence has reported the presence of several new Bug types rampaging through the ruins of Mahanagar. A good M.I. commander comes prepared to deal with these new threats. Burster Bursters eject a volatile substance that combusts after a short time delay. The dorsal glands that produce this substance also tend to explode upon the creature’s death. Hornets These flying Arachnids lack significant destructive firepower, but the real menace lies in their nests, which incessantly churn out a relentless swarm of Hornets. Hornet Tanker The Hornet Tanker carries Hornet nests on its back. Reaching and neutralizing this monstrosity, while managing the endless stream of Hornets, requires a careful approach. Ravager This Arachnid is a formidable foe capable of launching explosive projectiles. When it loses its tail from battle damage, it will charge in with its massive pincers. CONTENT SUMMARY: This expansion includes: A new richly detailed urban environment: Squash the Bugs in city streets, liberate a massive airport, clear internal buildings and venture through underground basements, sewers and metro lines. 9 mission story campaign, focused on open maps that offer tactical freedom 8 new player units, including mechanized missile launchers, hovering autocannons and airborne gunships 4 new defensive turret types 4 new Arachnid unit types", "review_summary": "Very Positive", "developer": "The Artistocrats", "publisher": "The Artistocrats", "game_tag": "Strategy", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 10 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " Intel Core i5 or equivalent"},

Apple IPhone Truedepth sensor and Oculus Quest 2 optical finger tracking ) to connect avatars to simultaneous inputs. This fusion of multiple sensor can combine many layers of motion capture in a single take; including: full body tracking, face capture, lipsync, gaze tracking, optical finger tracking. Highlights Record motion capture using custom avatars, scenes and props. Add custom shaders, textures, emotes expressions, dynamicbone physics and more.

Ghost curves for visualizing the future locations of multiple avatars in a scene. Gameplay The experience depends on the user's PC and the tracking hardware used. The recommended SteamVR headsets are the Valve Index or the HTC Vive. A Quest HMD may also produce reasonable results. It is also possible to use the software without an HMD (eg. when livestreaming). Full body tracking is only available when using feet and hip trackers (and optional elbows, knees, chest). Users may achieve more realistic tracking results when using body trackers. Body trackers are optional and standing mocap is supported. Further realism my be achieved on compatible avatars by also enabling face capture or using a Vive Pro Eye for gaze and blink tracking. History Originally this was designed as an intuitive way for users to create virtual training videos and presentation in an immersive VR environment for added realism and then export their animation for rendering.

Nemesis: Lockdown is a cinematic, turn-based sci-fi horror experience based on the award-winning board game. This is the thrilling tabletop Nemesis experience gone digital, along with its dark atmosphere, adrenaline-filled moments and unforgiving RNG. A base on Mars has been put on emergency lockdown due to an alien outbreak. You’re one of the few people left inside. Your goal is to fulfill a unique objective - which will put your survival skills to the test - and survive the lockdown by hiding or escaping the facility. You’ll do that by exploring the Intruder-infested corridors of the base in search of anything that might help you stay alive. Even then, your survival is all but guaranteed and sometimes your best efforts might not be enough. In Nemesis: Lockdown, you WILL die. And you’ll have a great time regardless. The core of Nemesis: Lockdown is its turn-based card gameplay. Each action requires you to play cards from your hand and their smart management is crucial to success. But success in the game relies not just on you and your skills. Random events, requiring you to think on your feet, happen each round, making the sessions exciting, dramatic… and even tougher. The game is a semi cooperative experience utilizing the hidden traitor mechanic. One of the players might secretly be working on sabotaging the mission. If you want to survive, you’ll have to expose them. If that player is you… well, you’d do anything to make it out alive, wouldn’t you? One thing’s for certain - you're going to be talking about your games long after the sessions are over. Features: - A thrilling single and multiplayer experience Regardless of whether you decide to go solo or team up with other players, you're in for a unique sci-fi horror experience. Each session of the game is filled with exciting events and terrifying encounters that make it uniquely dramatic. - Gameplay designed to keep you on your toes In Nemesis: Lockdown you don't hunt aliens - you're doing everything to outsmart them, fulfill your objective and get the hell out. And if you do that by betraying your allies along the way... well, nobody said sacrifices wouldn't be necessary to survive. Weapons in the game are more of a defense countermeasure than a reliable tool of alien extermination and the game's systems make sure that exploring the base is not a walk in the park. You're going to have your work cut out for you - that's for sure. - Secret goals and hidden traitors At the beginning of the game, you're assigned a secret objective. It may sometimes require you to deceive and mislead your teammates, or get rid of them altogether. You're going to have to tread a fine line of being a nuisance and not being exposed. So tread carefully - if they find out what you're up to, you'll be in even more trouble. - Based on the award-winning series of board games Nemesis is one of the most successful board games titles of recent years. It was created as a tribute to classic sci-fi horror movies. Its main goal was to create a horror experience that would evoke a cinematic story with every game. A story that you and your friends would want to talk about even long after the session's over.", "review_summary": "Mostly Positive", "developer": "InterStudio", "publisher": "InterStudio", "game_tag": "Board Game", "minimum_ram": " 8 GB RAM", "minimum_rom": " 10 GB available space", "minimum_cpu": " AMD Ryzen 5 1xxx / Intel Core i3 6gen"},

New Features Introduced War Aims: Set the scope and intensity of your wars. Choose from four escalating war aims, each affecting the diplomatic landscape differently, from limited skirmishes to full-scale annihilation. Tailor your warfare strategies without restrictions but beware of the galactic consequences if conflicts drag on too long. Invasion Tactics: Employ new tactics to siege and capture enemy core worlds and colonies. Choose from various invasion approaches, from Orbital Bombardments and Surface Invasions to specialized tactics like Biological Attacks or EMPs. Each method carries distinct advantages and potential repercussions for the invaded worlds. Enhanced Ship Types and Classes: Organize your fleets more effectively with new ship types and classes. Small Hulls now feature the agile Corvette alongside the sturdy Frigate, and new ship classes like the \"Wolf Hound\" Corvette class bring additional tactical options, such as increased hit points and specific operational abilities. Operational Abilities and Targeting Priorities: Customize your ship classes further with 14 new operational abilities and expanded targeting priorities. These allow for refined control over your fleet's actions in battle, enabling sophisticated strategies against diverse enemy formations. New Technologies and Ship Components: Research new technologies and equip your ships with innovative components that offer unique battlefield advantages. From Assault Shuttle pods that capture enemy vessels to Time Dilators that delay enemy actions, these components can be decisive in critical confrontations.

Inspired by genre classics, this is a serene adventure that sets you adrift in a fairytale world... it’s also an invitation to roleplay without the restraints of linear missions and plotlines. Feel at liberty to travel the free wilds and vivid cities of the Braided Shore peninsula. Wander deep into the layers of this hand-drawn world, stumble upon its hidden places or unravel one of its many mysteries. There is no overarching goal and no real beginning or end, but for mortal characters the stakes can be high. Braided Shore is a vast and intricate world, but meetings with other players are few and far between so your chance encounters will be something special. Choose to collaborate together or to survive alone, either way, you’ll be part of the birth of an exciting new online community, one where many stories will be told. But take note: This is a game for wayfinders and wanderers and it won’t plan out your route. Instead it will trust you to play in your own style and to shape your own journey. Whichever way you choose to travel, you’ll soon be adding your own chapters to Book of Travels. Authentic roleplaying and individual playstyles Pick one of 20+ Forms in a detailed character creation sheet that focuses on personality and identity rather than stats and classes.
